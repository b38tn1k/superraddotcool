Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it

But grace found my heart

Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboe



I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot




Love is thinking about others before you think about yourself

If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

I'm so sick of your love songs

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot




so come give me a hug, if u in there gettin rubbed



Taking me down rolling on the ground



Wenn wir auf diesen Fels hinsinken

(Sommartider)

Men filmen börjar om ändå

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot




Det kommer aldrig va över för mig



Say I never settled down

Mo' money, mo' problems, so I'd rather be broke

Watch it Babe

I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

But if you stand for nothing you'll fall very low

Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch (You're in love)

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot




If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

This time we know what will come

That feeling is the best thing



Sing it now Oh whoa ohFly me to the moon



Till I have your love

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot




I just wanna take your time

The mountainside

Uptown funk you up

Here I am to say that You're my God

Just a boat on the ocean

Give it to you!

But there's nothing to be afraid of

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot

Only know you love her when you let her go



It's funny when you get extra money

Firestones

Oh my god is this really the end

And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come

Go to church and pray to father Lord forgive us

Now that we are at war with the Axis again

Niggas die, every day all over

Deutschland will make you

All the wind out from my sails

Only way up out the hood rap crack or playin' ball

It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
