  Darlin', darlin'
Oh turn the lights back on now
Watchin', watchin'
As the credits all roll down
Cryin', cryin'
You know we're playing to a full house, house
No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
But in the end for you and me
Oh the show, it can't go on
We used to have it all
But now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause (woah woah oh oh)
And wave out to the crowd
And take our final bow
Oh it's our time to go
But at least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Darlin', darlin'
You know that we are sold out
This is fading
But the band plays on now
We're cryin', cryin'
So let the velvet roll down, down
No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
Our lines we read so perfectly
But the show, it can't go on
We used to have it all
But now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause (woah woah oh oh)
And wave out to the crowd
And take our final bow
Oh it's our time to go
But at least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Stole the show
Least we stole the show
Stole the show
Least we stole the show
It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way, from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew all the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
About another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it would'nt last
Had to switch up, look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays
Now I'll see you in a better place
How could we not talk about feelings when feelings all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way, from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
First you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turns to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broke, and the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached so remember me when I'm gone!
How could we not talk about feelings, when feelings all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way
yeah, hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home
It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way, from where we began
Oh i'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
  Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
  When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're 70
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just a touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey, your soul could never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby, now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
So baby, now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beatin' heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
  You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me, through the dark
Let me take you past the sattelites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do
Love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do
Touch me like you do
To-To-Touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch, of your skin
Is a Holy Grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around
I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do
Touch me like you do

So what?
I'm an Albatraoz
So what?
I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz
Yeah, 'bout FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that's all I want
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
  Dime si es verdad
Me dijeron que te estas casando
Tú no sabes como estoy sufriendo
Esto te lo tengo que decir
Cuéntame
Tu despedida para mi fue dura
Será que él te llevo a la luna
Y yo no supe hacerlo así
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Eso me esto está matando oh no
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta
Eso no me gusta
Vivir si ti, no aguanto más
Por eso vengo a decirte lo que siento
Estoy sufriendo en esta soledad
Y aunque tu padre no aprobó esta relación
Yo sigo insistiendo a pedir perdón
Lo único que importa está en tu corazón
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Esto me está matando oh no
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta
Eso no me gusta
Yo te juré a ti eterno amor
Y ahora otro te da calor
Cuando en las noches tienes frío oh oh
Yo sé que él te parece mejor
Pero yo estoy en tu corazón
Y por eso pido perdón
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta oh no
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Dicen que uno no sabe lo que tiene
(Yo sin ti)
Vale la pena luchar por lo que uno quiere
(No puedo vivir así)
Y hacer el intento
(No quiero vivir así)

I knew my rent was gonna be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough, to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
(Ne-Yo let's get it now)
This is the last twenty dollars I got
But I'ma have a good time ballin' tonight
Tell the bartender line up some shots
Because I'm gonna get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her wanna ride out, and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed
I knew my rent was gonna be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough, to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life

Better get yours cause I'm gonna get mine
Party every night like my last
Mami you know the drill, shake that ass
Go ahead baby, let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just want to see that thing drop
From the back to the front to the top
You know me, I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This is a fo sho, I'm not talking about luck
I'm not talking about love, I'm talking about lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up
I knew my rent was gonna be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough, to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Let's get it now

I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough, to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Let's get it now
  When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened up
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
In the dark I found, I stop and I won't fly
And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light, you're my flash light
I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
I'm not the afraid when the rain won't stop
Cause you light the way
You light the way, you light the way
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night

You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was on D like DOC, remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes

  Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
Say, could that lass be I?
Merry of soul she sailed on a day
Over the sea to Skye
Billow and breeze, islands and seas
Mountains of rain and sun
All that was good, all that was fair
All that was me is gone
Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
Say, could that lass be I?
Merry of soul she sailed on a day
Over the sea to Skye
Mitt mod försvann med åren hur ska jag nu gå fram hur
Fan va bra, står på stationen där är du ska du hem
fan va bra, är det för sent att kriga kvar över fem
fan va bra, att du ser att jag står här och ler
ska vi vara ikväll
fan va bra, i stegen fram slår hjärtat tvåhundrafem
här är jag, en galen själ som vill till hundra procent
ska vi dra härifrån, bara chansa och se hur det går
stog som en lallare på krogen kolla hörn och vrå
jag stog och undra om det var hit som du skulle gå
för nån gemensam vän sa att vi skulle klicka så
och hon kan slänga sig i väggen om hon hitta på
vi mötte blicken men jag tror jag kolla bort igen
så intressant och tänka hand i hand på vägen hem
vi kan väl flyga utan rädsla för och fall ner
jag kunde lova vad som helst om du klär av mig mer
Fan va bra, står på stationen där e du ska du hem
fan va bra, är det för sent att kriga kvar över fem
fan va bra, att du ser att jag står här och ler
ska vi vara ikväll
fan va bra, i stegen fram slår hjärtat tvåhundrafem
här är jag, en galen själ som vill till hundra procent
ska vi dra härifrån, bara chansa och se hur det går
du ser på mig, jag ser på dig, det är bara vi, vi är bara nu
det finns ett själ att vi är här, fan vad jag känner mig kär
du ser på mig, jag ser på dig, det är bara vi, vi är bara nu
det finns ett själ att vi är här
fan va bra (känner mig naken)
här är jag
ska vi dra
bara chansa och se hur det går
Fan va bra, står på stationen där är du ska du hem
fan va bra, är det för sent att kriga kvar över fem
fan va bra, att du ser att jag står här och ler
ska vi vara ikväll
fan va bra, i stegen fram slår hjärtat tvåhundrafem
här är jag, en galen själ som vill till hundra procent
ska vi dra härifrån, bara chansa och se hur det går
ja jag chansar och ser hur det går

'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you

So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
'Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
You know our love would be tragic
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
'Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
On that lonely night
You said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it there was only us
Convinced we were broken inside, inside
'Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
  Oh, I know why you chasing all the headlights
Oh, 'cause you always tryina get ahead of light
Baby when you go
You know I'll be waiting on the other side
And I'm always cold
But if you stay then I could keep you warm at night
Don't be a fool for the city lights
I know it's cool but it's only light
Baby with you I can never lie
Don't go chasing all the headlights
Oh, I could feel the beating of your heart on drum
Oh, don't know if I'm dreaming or if you have gone
Every time you go
Hits me like a bullet from a broken gun
Yeah I know it's cold
But if you stay then I could keep you warm at night
(x2)
Don't be a fool for the city lights
I know it's cool but it's only light
Baby with you I can never lie
So don't go chasing all the headlights
  Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Well that's OK baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's OK baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home
And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah let's be clear, I'll trust no one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart
  Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, Heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face"
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you've heard about
Me, so hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your
Queen, find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing, like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Ohh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm (Oh)
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm (Over)
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Somewhere we can go
And no one else can find
Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone

Loose everybody baby come undone

Looking like a good, good time
Don't disguise

Fresh from Monaco, preforming for Microsoft
I'm a hard worker, I'm far from the boss
But when it's said and done, I'm owning it all
I know you just think it's just rap
Just this, just that, haha, right
Now baby, this my life
Wanna have fun for a night?
Then just
Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
Oh my mind
Looking like a good, good time
Don't disguise
The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my mind
Don't be shy, I just wanna in tonight
Go headlining on tour, with Enrique
Off in Casa de Campo, who would've thought de que
Down in Key Largo, you know I'm on that sticky
Icky, icky, icky, icky
Don't do it much, but when I do, I'm gone
Don't take it all off, keep your heels and thong
Ay mamita that turns me on
Now just listen to the song and
Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
Oh my mind
Looking like a good, good time

Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave ya
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin'?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh Lord
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you the most
  We go hideaway in daylight
We go undercover when under sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty
That's where we run
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
Anybody's got the power
They don't see it
'Cause they don't understand
Spin around and run for hours
You and me we got the world in our hands
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be

Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself

It's so subtle, I'm in trouble
But I'd love to be in trouble with you
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got to give it up to me
I'm screaming mercy, mercy please
Just like they say it in the song

And when you leave me all alone
I'm like a stray without a home
I'm like a dog without a bone
I just want you for my own
I got to have you babe
Woah
There's loving in your eyes
That pulls me closer
It's so subtle, I'm in trouble
But I'd love to be in trouble with you
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or boy-skinned or black, baby I drop
These boricua mommies screamin "Ay papi!"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggaz gettin mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back
What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start
Bitches screamin they want That old thing back

Notorious known to bustin in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!

Cause I only be knowin how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin I got my swagger back
I'm lookin like bitch, my swagger never left
It's so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back
Is my mind playin tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin nightmares of girls killin me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot
But lickin clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though

So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker

And when I'm done I got to split shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin for an intermission
Fuck the kissin, lickin down to your belly button, I ain't frontin
Biggie Smalls
Bad Boy for life
Once again going to the top baby
  You and me we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though God knows you have mine
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know I
I know I'm Not The Only One
  What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
My head's underwater but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me, loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all, to me, I'll give my all, to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all, of me
And you give me all, of you, Oh-Oh
How many times do I have to tell you?
"Even when you're crying you're beautiful too"
The world is beating you down I'm around through every move
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you
My head's underwater but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me, loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all, to me, I'll give my all, to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all, of me

And I can hear the sirens burning, red lights turning

  My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean
Oh oh, amen, amen, amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor
Nothin' on me
And I can't take it no more
It's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door
Where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave, yeah
In the back of the cab
I tip the driver, head to town
Give me the best
I got your body on my mind
I want it back
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
Girl, you don't want
I want you to want me
And if you want, hey girl, you got me

And you whisper in my ear, baby I'm yours
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
Girl, you don't want
I want you to want me
And if you want, hey girl, you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do

And if you want, hey girl, you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you
Just to get up next you
  I drew a broken heart
Right on your window pane
Waited for your reply
Here in the pouring rain
Just breathe against the glass
Leave me some kind of sign
I know the hurt won't pass yeah
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
I never meant to break your heart
Now I won't let this plane go down

Oh, you gotta hold on
Hold on to what you're feeling
That feeling is the best thing
The best thing alright

I know this love is heading in the same direction
That's up
You drew a question mark
But you know what I want
I wanna turn the card over
Right back to where it was
So let's a build a bridge yeah
From your side to mine
I'll be the one to cross over
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
I never meant to break your heart
Now I won't let this plane go down
I never meant to make you cry
I'll do what it takes to make this fly
Oh, you gotta hold on
Hold on to what you're feeling
That feeling is the best thing

  You shout it out
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized
But all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down
But I get up
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
Shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium
Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard, those bulletproof glass
You shoot me down,
but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down,
but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down,
but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down,
but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium

Finally met a girl that do for me though
It's crazy, it's like a dream
I think I got me one
  Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around
We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No we can't be defeated
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around
  Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
Cause baby now we got bad blood
Hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve it
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood
Hey!
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shining now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me?
Where I'm weak baby I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I
Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
Cause baby now we got bad blood
Hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood
Hey!
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if your coming my way, just don't
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I
Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done

  Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Oh, won't you stay with me 'cause you're all I need?
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
Oh, won't you stay with me 'cause you're all I need?
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Oh, won't you stay with me 'cause you're all I need?
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Oh, won't you stay with me 'cause you're all I need?
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
She had dumps like a truck, truck, truck
Thighs like what, what, what
All night long (all night long)
Let me see that thong
I like it when the beat goes
Baby make your booty go
Girl I know you wanna show
That thong, th-th-th-thong
Shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake
Shake your booty
Shake your booty
How
Shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake
Shake your booty
Shake your booty
Shorty had that apple bottom jeans
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shorty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
TJ, can you handle this?
David, can you handle this?
Clay, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
cause my body's too bootylicious for you, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
cause my body's too bootylicious for you, babe
I like big butts and I cannot lie
(no lie)
You other brothers can't deny
(I won't)
When a girl walks in
With her itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
Wanna pull out your tongue
You know what matters
Courtship and chivalry
I'll take you to a nice hot meal and I'll tip the waiter
I went skydiving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm homebound
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends
Talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Oh, what's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
This is how we do it
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
This is how we do it
South Central does it like nobody does
This is how we do it
To all my neighbors you got much flavor
This is how we do it
Girls you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That girl is poison
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is poison
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what's, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what's, so what's the scenario
Here we go
Insane in the membrane (insane in the brain)
Insane in the membrane (insane in the brain)
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're getting me
Getting me through the night
  I was a liar, I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar (Come on)
And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But boy I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you
So one last time, I need to be
The one who takes you home, one more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I'll swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me, at least just temporarily?
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful (Come on)
And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But boy I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, Baby
So one last time, I need to be
The one who takes you home, one more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home
I know I shouldn't fight it
At least I'm being honest
Just stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it
'Cause I don't wanna be with you
So one last time, I need to be
The one who takes you home, one more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home
  Darlin', darlin'
Oh turn the lights back on now
Watchin', watchin'
As the credits all roll down
Cryin', cryin'
You know we're playing to a full house, house
No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
But in the end for you and me
Oh the show, it can't go on
We used to have it all
But now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause (woah woah oh oh)
And wave out to the crowd
And take our final bow
Oh it's our time to go
But at least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Darlin', darlin'
You know that we are sold out
This is fading
But the band plays on now
We're cryin', cryin'
So let the velvet roll down, down
No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
Our lines we read so perfectly
But the show, it can't go on
We used to have it all
But now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause (woah woah oh oh)
And wave out to the crowd
And take our final bow
Oh it's our time to go
But at least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Stole the show
Least we stole the show
Stole the show
Least we stole the show
It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way, from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew all the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
About another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it would'nt last
Had to switch up, look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays
Now I'll see you in a better place
How could we not talk about feelings when feelings all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way, from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
First you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turns to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broke, and the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached so remember me when I'm gone!
How could we not talk about feelings, when feelings all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way
yeah, hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home
It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way, from where we began
Oh i'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
  Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
  When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're 70
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just a touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey, your soul could never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby, now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
So baby, now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beatin' heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
  You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me, through the dark
Let me take you past the sattelites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do
Love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do
Touch me like you do
To-To-Touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch, of your skin
Is a Holy Grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around
I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do
Touch me like you do
To-To-Touch me like you do

What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do

She called herself the ho
With the money, money blow
But fuck that little mouse 'cause I'm an Albatraoz

So what?
I'm an Albatraoz
So what?
I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz
Yeah, 'bout FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that's all I want
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
  Dime si es verdad
Me dijeron que te estas casando
Tú no sabes como estoy sufriendo
Esto te lo tengo que decir
Cuéntame
Tu despedida para mi fue dura
Será que él te llevo a la luna
Y yo no supe hacerlo así
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Eso me esto está matando oh no
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta
Eso no me gusta
Vivir si ti, no aguanto más
Por eso vengo a decirte lo que siento
Estoy sufriendo en esta soledad
Y aunque tu padre no aprobó esta relación
Yo sigo insistiendo a pedir perdón
Lo único que importa está en tu corazón
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Esto me está matando oh no
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta
Eso no me gusta
Yo te juré a ti eterno amor
Y ahora otro te da calor
Cuando en las noches tienes frío oh oh
Yo sé que él te parece mejor
Pero yo estoy en tu corazón
Y por eso pido perdón
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta oh no
Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Dicen que uno no sabe lo que tiene
(Yo sin ti)
Vale la pena luchar por lo que uno quiere
(No puedo vivir así)
Y hacer el intento
(No quiero vivir así)

I knew my rent was gonna be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough, to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
(Ne-Yo let's get it now)
This is the last twenty dollars I got
But I'ma have a good time ballin' tonight
Tell the bartender line up some shots
Because I'm gonna get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her wanna ride out, and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed
I knew my rent was gonna be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough, to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life

Tonight I'm gonna lose my mind
Better get yours cause I'm gonna get mine
Party every night like my last
Mami you know the drill, shake that ass
Go ahead baby, let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just want to see that thing drop
From the back to the front to the top
You know me, I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This is a fo sho, I'm not talking about luck
I'm not talking about love, I'm talking about lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up
I knew my rent was gonna be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough, to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Let's get it now

I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough, to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Let's get it now
  When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened up
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
In the dark I found, I stop and I won't fly
And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light, you're my flash light
I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
I'm not the afraid when the rain won't stop
Cause you light the way
You light the way, you light the way
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night

You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was on D like DOC, remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show

  Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
Say, could that lass be I?
Merry of soul she sailed on a day
Over the sea to Skye
Billow and breeze, islands and seas
Mountains of rain and sun
All that was good, all that was fair
All that was me is gone
Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
Say, could that lass be I?
Merry of soul she sailed on a day
Over the sea to Skye
Mitt mod försvann med åren hur ska jag nu gå fram hur
Fan va bra, står på stationen där är du ska du hem
fan va bra, är det för sent att kriga kvar över fem
fan va bra, att du ser att jag står här och ler
ska vi vara ikväll
fan va bra, i stegen fram slår hjärtat tvåhundrafem
här är jag, en galen själ som vill till hundra procent
ska vi dra härifrån, bara chansa och se hur det går
stog som en lallare på krogen kolla hörn och vrå
jag stog och undra om det var hit som du skulle gå
för nån gemensam vän sa att vi skulle klicka så
och hon kan slänga sig i väggen om hon hitta på
vi mötte blicken men jag tror jag kolla bort igen
så intressant och tänka hand i hand på vägen hem
vi kan väl flyga utan rädsla för och fall ner
jag kunde lova vad som helst om du klär av mig mer
Fan va bra, står på stationen där e du ska du hem
fan va bra, är det för sent att kriga kvar över fem
fan va bra, att du ser att jag står här och ler
ska vi vara ikväll

'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you

So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
'Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
You know our love would be tragic
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
'Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
On that lonely night
You said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it there was only us
Convinced we were broken inside, inside
'Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
  Oh, I know why you chasing all the headlights
Oh, 'cause you always tryina get ahead of light
Baby when you go
You know I'll be waiting on the other side
And I'm always cold
But if you stay then I could keep you warm at night
Don't be a fool for the city lights
I know it's cool but it's only light
Baby with you I can never lie
Don't go chasing all the headlights
Oh, I could feel the beating of your heart on drum
Oh, don't know if I'm dreaming or if you have gone
Every time you go
Hits me like a bullet from a broken gun
Yeah I know it's cold
But if you stay then I could keep you warm at night
(x2)
Don't be a fool for the city lights
I know it's cool but it's only light
Baby with you I can never lie
So don't go chasing all the headlights
  Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Well that's OK baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's OK baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home
And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah let's be clear, I'll trust no one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart
  Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, Heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face"
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you've heard about
Me, so hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your
Queen, find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing, like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Ohh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm (Oh)
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm (Over)
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Somewhere we can go

Fresh from Monaco, preforming for Microsoft
I'm a hard worker, I'm far from the boss
But when it's said and done, I'm owning it all
I know you just think it's just rap
Just this, just that, haha, right
Now baby, this my life
Wanna have fun for a night?
Then just
Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
Oh my mind
Looking like a good, good time
Don't disguise
The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my mind

Go headlining on tour, with Enrique
Off in Casa de Campo, who would've thought de que
Down in Key Largo, you know I'm on that sticky
Icky, icky, icky, icky
Don't do it much, but when I do, I'm gone
Don't take it all off, keep your heels and thong
Ay mamita that turns me on
Now just listen to the song and
Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
Oh my mind
Looking like a good, good time

Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
Loosen everybody till they come undone
Loosen everybody baby come undone
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave ya
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin'?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh Lord
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you

  We go hideaway in daylight
We go undercover when under sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty
That's where we run
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
Anybody's got the power
They don't see it
'Cause they don't understand
Spin around and run for hours
You and me we got the world in our hands
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be

Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or boy-skinned or black, baby I drop
These boricua mommies screamin "Ay papi!"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'

Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

Willie D, havin nightmares of girls killin me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass

Biggie Smalls
Bad Boy for life
Once again going to the top baby
  You and me we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though God knows you have mine
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know I
I know I'm Not The Only One
  What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
My head's underwater but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me, loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all, to me, I'll give my all, to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all, of me
And you give me all, of you, Oh-Oh
How many times do I have to tell you?
"Even when you're crying you're beautiful too"
The world is beating you down I'm around through every move
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you
My head's underwater but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me, loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all, to me, I'll give my all, to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all, of me
And you give me all, of you, Oh-Oh
Give me all of you, Oh
Cards on my table we're both showing hearts
Risking it although it's hard
'Cause all of me, loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all, to me I'll give my all, to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all, of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all, of me, Yeah
And you give me all, Oh-Oh
  You take me down, spin me around
You got me running all the lights
Don't make a sound, talk to me now
Let me inside your mind
Don't know what you're thinking, sugar, ooh
But I just got that feeling, sugar, ooh
And I can hear the sirens burning, red lights turning
I can't turn back now
So hold on tight
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Da-dan-da-dangerous
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Show me your soul, I gotta know
Bet that you're beautiful inside
Toes on the glass, car moving fast
Come take the wheel and drive
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar, mmm, yeah
But I just got that feeling, sugar, mmm, yeah
And I can hear the sirens burning, red lights turning
I can't turn back now
So hold on tight
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Da-dan-da-dangerous
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Da-dan-da-dangerous
It's dangerous, so dangerous

I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Da-dan-da-dangerous
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Da-dan-da-dangerous

  My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean
Oh oh, amen, amen, amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor
Nothin' on me
And I can't take it no more
It's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door
Where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave, yeah
In the back of the cab
I tip the driver, head to town
Give me the best
I got your body on my mind
I want it back
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
Girl, you don't want
I want you to want me
And if you want, hey girl, you got me

And you whisper in my ear, baby I'm yours
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
Girl, you don't want
I want you to want me
And if you want, hey girl, you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do

And if you want, hey girl, you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you
Just to get up next you
  I drew a broken heart
Right on your window pane
Waited for your reply
Here in the pouring rain
Just breathe against the glass
Leave me some kind of sign
I know the hurt won't pass yeah
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
I never meant to break your heart
Now I won't let this plane go down

Oh, you gotta hold on
Hold on to what you're feeling
That feeling is the best thing
The best thing alright

I know this love is heading in the same direction
That's up
You drew a question mark
But you know what I want
I wanna turn the card over
Right back to where it was
So let's a build a bridge yeah
From your side to mine
I'll be the one to cross over
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
I never meant to break your heart
Now I won't let this plane go down
I never meant to make you cry
I'll do what it takes to make this fly
Oh, you gotta hold on
Hold on to what you're feeling
That feeling is the best thing

  You shout it out
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized
But all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down
But I get up
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
Shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium
Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard, those bulletproof glass
You shoot me down,
but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down,
but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down,
but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down,
but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium

Finally met a girl that do for me though
It's crazy, it's like a dream
I think I got me one
  Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around
We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No we can't be defeated
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around
  Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
Cause baby now we got bad blood
Hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve it
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood
Hey!
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shining now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me?
Where I'm weak baby I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I
Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
Cause baby now we got bad blood
Hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood
Hey!
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if your coming my way, just don't
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I

You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done

  Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Oh, won't you stay with me 'cause you're all I need?
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
Oh, won't you stay with me 'cause you're all I need?
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Oh, won't you stay with me 'cause you're all I need?
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Oh, won't you stay with me 'cause you're all I need?
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
She had dumps like a truck, truck, truck
Thighs like what, what, what
All night long (all night long)
Let me see that thong
I like it when the beat goes
Baby make your booty go
Girl I know you wanna show
That thong, th-th-th-thong
Shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake
Shake your booty
Shake your booty
How
Shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake
Shake your booty
Shake your booty
Shorty had that apple bottom jeans
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shorty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
TJ, can you handle this?
David, can you handle this?
Clay, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
cause my body's too bootylicious for you, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
cause my body's too bootylicious for you, babe
I like big butts and I cannot lie
(no lie)
You other brothers can't deny
(I won't)
When a girl walks in
With her itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
Wanna pull out your tongue
You know what matters
Courtship and chivalry
I'll take you to a nice hot meal and I'll tip the waiter
I went skydiving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm homebound
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends
Talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Oh, what's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
This is how we do it
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
This is how we do it
South Central does it like nobody does
This is how we do it
To all my neighbors you got much flavor
This is how we do it
Girls you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That girl is poison
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is poison
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what's, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what's, so what's the scenario
Here we go
Insane in the membrane (insane in the brain)
Insane in the membrane (insane in the brain)
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're getting me
Getting me through the night
  I was a liar, I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar (Come on)
And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But boy I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you
So one last time, I need to be
The one who takes you home, one more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I'll swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me, at least just temporarily?
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful (Come on)
And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But boy I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, Baby
So one last time, I need to be
The one who takes you home, one more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home
I know I shouldn't fight it
At least I'm being honest
Just stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it
'Cause I don't wanna be with you
So one last time, I need to be
The one who takes you home, one more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home
  Oh cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
Ah la la
Ah la la
How I wish that you were mine
How I wish that you were mine
Give it to me, I'm worth it

  Louis: It seems today, that all you see is violence in movies,
Peter: But where are those good old-fashioned values,
on which we used to rely?
Brian: It used to be, a big time star was elegant as Garbo,
Stewie: But now we get whores like Jenny Lopez,
Lucky theres a man who positively can do
all the things that make us-
Stewie: Laugh and cry!
Louis: When I was young, the songs were fair,
Louis: A heartache all gone awry!
Brian: The classic films were works of arts,
Stewie: But now we get Matrix Revolution,
Im sorry I know this doesnt rhyme,
but what the hell were you Wachowski Brothers thinking?!
sweeter than vanilla, wholesome as a piece of-
Stewie: Apple Pie!
Lois: Peter!
(fart sound effect)
Lois: The Brady Bunch has got their Mike and
But who around here could fill those loafers?
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the thing that make us-
Stewie: Laugh and Cry!
Thats expensive! Look, just the fact that I came up with the idea
should tell you I'm generous;
Meg: Uh, can we turn the spotlight down a bit?
With that light shining on you from that angle,
Brian: Yeah, you've told me that before and uh,
Stewie: Really?! How so?
Brian: Well, you- you got that thing going on with your eyes
You know how her eyes are just like a hair too far apart?
Uh, a- a- almost like there was some immediate post-birth
surgery that should have been done but it was the south,
Chris: Mom!
Lois: Yes honey?
We got music, we got comedy,
Lois: Thats right! For example, not a lot of people know this,
but in one episode of the show there was a flashback of Brian
who looked enough like him,
so they actually built a dog suit for the scene,
and the actor of inside the suit was Raven-Symon,
You know the sound stage where we shoot Family Guy
is the same stage where they shot the Golden Girls
back in the 80s, right?
I guess there was one night when they were all ready to shoot,
So everybodys freaking out and uh, then one of the producers runs in
Lois: Oh My God!
before the show and uh, they found her standing on the street corner,
Brian: Oh My God!
Meg: Ew! Thats Disgusting!
Peter: Can you believe that?
Stewie: I say, what is it with these actors?
They're perfectly normal people in civilian life
Although I must say I am amazed at the language you can get away with
And I thought to myself, "My God, that- that Dick Wolf just does
whatever he damn well pleases, doesnt he?
I wonder how he'd like it if I just walked into his living room
Lois: You know,
Stewie: I am a show you lack-witted beetle head! Ugh!
Peter: How are ya, sweetheart?
Lois: So was it really that bad babysitting Stewie?
So after you and Peter left for dinner,

  Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off
Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She said it was something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Chasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you
  Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up, don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
You gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Who are you to trust, who are you?
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

  Du ska inte tro det blir sommar
Ifall inte nån sätter fart
På sommarn och gör lite somrigt
Då kommer blommorna snart
Jag gör så att blommorna blommar
Jag gör hela kohagen grön
Och nu så har sommaren kommit
För jag har just tagit bort snön
Jag gör mycket vatten i bäcken
Så där så det hoppar och far
Jag gör fullt med svalor som flyger
Och myggor som svalorna tar
Jag gör löven nya på träden
Och små fågelbon här och där
Jag gör himlen vacker om kvällen
För jag gör den alldeles skär
Och smultron det gör jag åt barna
För det tycker jag dom kan få
Och andra små roliga saker
Som passar när barna är små
Och jag gör så roliga ställen
Där barna kan springa omkring
Då blir barna fulla med sommar
Och bena blir fulla med spring

Feeling frightened of
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes

When tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
Darkness all around, I hope that I could fly
And I sing along, I sing along
And I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
Cause I look around me and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
But you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
I can't stop my heart
When you're shining in my eyes
I can't lie, it's a sweet life

  Sam Smith:
Yes, I do, I believe
That one day I will be
Where I was right there
Right next to you
And it's hard
The days just seems so dark
The moon, the stars
Are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin
Where do I begin?
No words can explain
The way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness
This hole that I'm inside
These tears
They tell their own story
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
John Legend:
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
Together:
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
John Legend:
Lay me down tonight
Sam Smith:
Lay me by your side
John Legend:
Lay me down tonight
Sam Smith:
Lay me by your side
Together:
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you
You
Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you
I should just tell you to leave cause
I know exactly where it leads but I watch it go round and round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl fate and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl
Some other girl"
He says "What you've heard is true but I
I said "I've been there too a few times"
Take me home
Just take me home
Just take me home
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back everytime
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
  Yo, Treble!
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Loves gonna get you down
I went walking with my momma one day
When she warned me what people say
Live your life until love is found
'Cause loves gonna get you down
Take a look at the girl next door
She's a player and a downright bore
Jesus loves her but she wants more
Oh, bad girls get you down
Sing it!
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Mama told me what I should know
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
If she loves you let her go
'Cause love only gets you down
Take a look at a boy like me
Never stood on my own two feet
Now I'm blue as I can be
Oh, love only got me down
Sing it!
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh loves gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh loves gonna get you down
Oh loves gonna get you down

Make time for me
Don't leave me lonely
And know we'll never see your family more than mine
I'll be sleeping on the left side of the bed (hey)
Open doors for me and you may get some kisses
Don't have a dirty mind
Just be a classy guy
Buy me a ring
Buy-buy me a ring, babe
You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright
Dear future husband,
Here's a few things
You'll need to know if you want to be
My one and only all my life
Dear future husband,
If you wanna get that special loving
Tell me I'm beautiful each and every night
Future husband, better love me right
  He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be your preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
He'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger, you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand
He could have your humour, that I don't understand cause
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can
A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
We both have demons, that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're still seeking an honest man
And stop deceiving Lord please
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

  Oh misty eye of the Mountain below,
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls,
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke,
If this is to end in fire,
Then we shall all burn together,
Watch the flames climb higher,
Calling out father oh,
Stand by and we will,
Watch the flames burn on along,
The mountainside,
And if we should die tonight,
Raise a glass of wine,
Calling out father oh,
Prepare as we will,
Watch the flames burn on along,
Now I see fire,
I see fire,
And I see fire,
I see fire,
Oh should my people fall then,
Confined in mountain halls,
Calling out father oh,
Hold fast and we will,
Watch the flames burn auburn on,
Now I see fire,
I see fire,
And I see fire,
I see fire,
And if the night is burning,
I will cover my eyes,
For if the dark returns,
And as the sky is falling down,
And with that shadow upon the ground,
I see fire,
I see fire,
I see fire,
I see fire,
I see fire,
And I see fire,
And I see fire burn on along,
The mountainside
He was the top man at his craft,
Oh, you can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said, love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
Hey sister, go sister, soul sister, go sister
Giuchie, Giuchie, ya ya dada (Hey hey hey)
Giuchie, Giuchie, ya ya here

And now it's time for a breakdown
  What do you feel if I say you can come to my paradise
and where will you go if I say the mountain's full-like snowed wood ice

  Hey, once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day my father—he told me,
He took me in his arms, I heard him say,
"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
One day my father—he told me,
When I was just a kid I heard him say,
"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind

These are the nights that never die
My father told me
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
Hey, hey
  Yo te miro, se me corta la respiración
Cuanto tu me miras se me sube el corazón
(Me palpita lento el corazon)
Y en silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Tu cuerpo y el mio llenando el vacío
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Ese fuego por dentro me esta enloqueciendo
Me va saturando
Con tu física y tu química también tu anatomía
La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la mía
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas) Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Con esta melodía, tu color, tu fantasía
Con tu filosofía mi cabeza esta vacía
Y ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo
Una noche loca (una noche loca)
Ay besar tu boca (y besar tu boca)
Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo una noche loca
Con tremenda loca
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
Tu me miras y me llevas a otra dimensión
(Estoy en otra dimensión)
Tu latidos aceleran a mi corazón
(Tu latidos aceleran a mi corazón)
Que ironía del destino no poder tocarte
Abrazarte y sentir la magia de tu olor
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Tu cuerpo y el mio llenando el vacío
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Ese fuego por dentro me esta enloqueciendo
Me va saturando

  Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn?
I push it down, push it do-o-own
I'm the one for a good time call
Phone's blowing up ringing my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the lo-o-ove
1-2-3-1-2-3 drink

Like it doesn't exist
I'm, gonna fly, like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
Cause she's so fancy
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
Cause she's so fancy
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
(Whoo!)
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
(Ohh)
This summer's gonna hurt
It's gonna hurt
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
Cause she's so fancy
Cause she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
  So effortless
Everything feels brand new
Whenever I'm here with you
I don't wanna be nowhere else
But I guess you can already tell
It's feeling just like one love
Is pulling up both of us
No matter what seasons do
I'm always gonna roll with you
Cause we float like the river, oh
Bring sweet to the bitter, oh
If we fall then we get up, oh
We don't even try
Cause through it all
It's effortless
So effortless
It's effortless
We don't even try, not at all
Not at all, so effortless, yeah
I'm gonna invest in us
I'm feeling like you're good luck
Like a, like a billion dollar trust
That's just about to open up
We're glowing like bright sunlight
Cause happines just abides
As long as we keep this tide
It's gonna be an easy ride
Cause we float like the river, oh
Bring sweet to the bitter, oh
If we fall then we get up, oh
We don't even try
Cause through it all
It's effortless
So effortless

We don't even try, not at all
Not at all, not at all
So effortless

So effortless
  Talking loud, talking crazy
Love me outside
Pray for the rain to come
Don't dry again
Guess it's true what they say
I'm always late
Say you need a little space
I'm in your way
It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part
I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for
What I did for love
What I did for love
I'm a fool for your games
But I always play
Can't admit it was a waste
It's too much escape
It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part
I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for
  I'm sorry for everything
Oh, everything I've done
Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh, I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh I'm going to mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
Am I out of luck?
Am I waiting to break?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishing I had
What I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh I'm going to mess this up
Oh it's just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
In the meantime, can we let it go
At the roadside that we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bayside where you used to show
In the moonlight we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me
Oh, let it drift away
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
In the meantime, can we let it go
At the roadside that we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bayside where you used to show
In the moonlight we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me
Oh, let it drift away
  Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

  When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened up
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
In the dark I found, I stop and I won't fly
And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light, you're my flash light
I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
I'm not the afraid when the rain won't stop
Cause you light the way
You light the way, you light the way
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light, you're my flash light
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light, you're my flash light
  Many times I've tried to tell you
Many times I've cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you
Cut my feelings to the bone
Don't wanna leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together
Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit?
Do we distort the facts?
Now, there's no looking forward
Now, there's no turning back
When you say
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together
Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere
Still you say
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
Look, I feel blessed
Way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
Straight up, look
I live the life I deserve, bless
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gonna go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd
And Eddy, who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you dog, that shit get petty
Bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three
Man this why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just got it, thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your profit we profit, oh God
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothing
Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from something it's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys the business man
It is what it is, trust me you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying about whoever's next
I am just worried about my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up cause I can't let them down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align, you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time on the overtime
Yeah I'm not invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who put it back together?
  (instrumental)
  Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where it starts﻿
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
Didn't know I was lost
Didn't know I was lost
Didn't know I was lost
Didn't know I was lost

Who Is Rickey Wayne?: The Mixtape
Ya feel me? Yah, ahem
First, let me hop out the motherfuckin' Porsche
I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be ballin' on these niggas, got me feelin' like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many thangs I ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit, crowned by the toilet
I'm just barely gettin' started, you already upset
Got a tiger as a pet, I just took him to the vet
Homie, I be makin' hits, I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me like she was on the feeder
If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout features, homeboy, you's a peon
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you gettin' peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold, I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set, just in case they wanna sleep on, ya dig?
I'm a full-time player, hoppin' out in alligator
Sippin' lean and Now and Later, homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle, you gon' have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her, I would never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely gettin' love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fuckin' with me
I be killin' this shit, pray to God they forgive me
They said, "when you blow up, don't forget me", man
I been on fire ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on ya, homie, I ain't talkin' diapers
Walk into your function, on point, I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexin' all you want but homeboy, you ain't ready
Ten times sharper than Michael Myers' machete
Been about the money, I ain't worried 'bout the fame
'Bout to have everybody sayin', "Who Is Rickey Wayne?"
  Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars, yeah we'll be counting stars
I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and you shall find
Oh, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be

But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,

Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Oh, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that downs me makes me wanna fly
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

5 more hours, we're just getting started
(5 more hours, we're just getting started)
  Tried to keep you close to me,
But life got in between
Tried to square not being there
But think that I should have been
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back
Once upon a different life
We rode our bikes into the sky
But now we're caught against the tide
Those distant days are flashing by
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back
Hold oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho
Lonely water, lonely water won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Lonely water, lonely water won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back
Lonely water, lonely water won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Lonely water, lonely water won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
  Nossa, nossa
Assim você me mata
Ai se eu te pego
Ai ai se eu te pego
Delícia, delícia
Assim você me mata
Ai se eu te pego
Ai ai se eu te pego
Sábado na balada
A galera começou a dançar
E passou a menina mais linda
Tomei coragem e comecei a falar
Nossa, nossa
Assim você me mata
Ai se eu te pego
Ai ai se eu te pego
Delícia, delícia
Assim você me mata
Ai se eu te pego
Ai ai se eu te pego
Sábado na balada
A galera começou a dançar
E passou a menina mais linda
Tomei coragem e comecei a falar
Nossa, nossa
Assim você me mata
Ai se eu te pego
Ai ai se eu te pego
Delícia, delícia
Assim você me mata
Ai se eu te pego
Ai ai se eu te pego
Nossa, nossa
Assim você me mata
Ai se eu te pego
Ai ai se eu te pego
Delícia, delícia
Assim você me mata
Ai se eu te pego
Ai ai se eu te pego
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you
My sincerest apologies, I mean it
I'll admit it, all being pathetic
I'm in my late 20s still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It's not your fault they try to get me, cause I'ma need to sail
Cause I'm selfish and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat but don't wanna see you on sale
Cause I failed and see you bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
And I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them
Preparing for that day, I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more
I'm wrong
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin' let him go
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now but I can promise you forever though
I'll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a women I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques but still I got the floors
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move On's
And dark, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady she got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married to, you solo I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent in how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, more flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions
But, I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though
  You know wherever you go i will follow you
And no matter what's wrong and how long
You are the sweetest thing i've ever seen
The cutest girl i've ever dreamed of
You are perfect to me
You have that funny side that makes me smile
My heart stops for a while
I try to meet you all the time
I still wait, wait, i'm still waiting for you, waiting for your call
And i only sing this song for you
It seems that your dreams i just can't fulfill
But i'll just go on and write songs
Yeah with your curly hair and narrow hips
Deep blue eyes and cherry lips
You're the girl of all of my dreams
And when i hear you talk and see you smile
I wanna kiss you for a while
I still wait, wait, i'm still waiting for you, waiting for your call
And i only sing this song for you
I know i do belong to you
I know it's true, haven't got a clue
What to do to own your heart
I try to find some words for you
I don't know how i'm getting through
  You got me so wild
How can I ever deny
You got me so high
So high I cannot feel the fire
And you keep telling me
Telling me that you'll be sweet
And you'll never want to leave my side
As long as I don't break these
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
I'm your dream girl
This is real love
But you know what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem
(And they still feel all so wasted on myself)
Sweat
Dripping down your chest
Thinking 'bout your tattooed knuckles
On my thigh boy boy boy
Cold
Shower you got no
Power to control
How I make you my toy toy toy
My hips rocking
As we keep lip locking
Got the neighbors screaming
Even louder louder
Lick me down like you were
Rolling rizla
I'm smoking
Come and put me out
(So wasted on myself)
I'm your dream girl
This is real love
But you know what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem
Oh baby
You so bad boy
Drive me mad boy
But you don't care when they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem
(And they still feel all so wasted on myself)
  Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do
I let myself go
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you
I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
Ya gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you
At first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
On a night so warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you
  Right
I shoulda known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
'Cause most guys only want one thing
But I'm undecided trying to figure out if that's you
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive
'Cause ooo you're so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags'd be a good sign
Don't you come here thinking you ballin'
Oh nah, ain't down for it
You seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean
And the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean
Smells like trouble to me
Opposites attract, I guess this is that
Good girl, bad guy, what a perfect match
And if we fuck you gon' wanna pay back tithes
When we finish you gon' feel like you was baptized
See baby now you fiendin' for a test drive
'Cause you don't wanna lose your ride to the next guy
And baby trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags'd be a good sign
Don't you come here thinking you're ballin'
Oh no, ain't down for it
You seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean
And the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean
Smells like trouble to me
I gotta beg for him in the worst way
Dear Lord, how'd I get in this position then
I Shoulda never got involved in the first place
Second place never get the recognition, mmm
See what he doin' to me make me have to shout it out
Gotta hold on me, that's without a doubt
So clear now that he's a trouble starter
But I ain't a saint neither and these ain't no still waters
Just 'cause all the girls are falling at your feet
Don't mean no thing to me
'Til you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me
Just 'cause all the girls are falling at your feet
Don't mean no thing to me
Until you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me
I shoulda known you were bad news
(Knew you were bad news)
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
(All of the tattoos)
I shoulda known you were bad news
(Knew you were bad news)
But I'm undecided tryin' to figure out if that's you
Trouble to me
Don't you come here thinking you ballin'
Oh no, ain't down for it
You seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean
And the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean
Smells like trouble to me

  Oh don't you dare look back
I said your holding back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
We were victims of the night,
The chemical, physical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and faded light
Oh we were born to get together,
She took my arm,
We took the floor and she said
Oh don't you dare look back
I said your holding back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,
I knew we were born to be together,
born to be together
She took my arm,
We took the floor and she said
Oh don't you dare look back
I said your holding back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
Deep in her eyes,
She took my arm,
We took the floor and she said
Oh don't you dare look back
I said your holding back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance!
Oh don't you dare look back
I said your holding back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
  Be careful making wishes in the dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
Besides in the meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the details with the devil
Now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Get your hands up, put 'em in the sky for the homies
That didn't make it and the folks locked down
Make millions every year
International champions
Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I, all I do is win
Hey!
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (Light em up, up, up)
And they stay there (Light em up, up, up)
And they stay there (Light em up, up, up)
I'm on fire
Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you're goin' in, put your hands in the air,
make 'em stay there! (Light em up, up, up)
And they stay there (Light em up, up, up)
And they stay there (Light em up, up, up)
I'm on fire
Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you're goin' in, put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there!
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
  I say why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad
Getting what I want, boy
Why does that make you so mad?
You see, why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad
'Cause if it's trouble that you're looking for
Oh baby, here I am
Oh baby, here I am
So why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad
Bad
I say why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad
Getting what I want, boy
Why does that make you so mad?
You see, why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad
'Cause if it's trouble that you're looking for
Oh baby, here I am
Oh baby, here I am
Bad
  Yes, I do, I believe
One day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright?
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright?
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
  Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candles burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
Even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you've brought us through the years
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candles burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed yourself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From the country lost
Without your soul who missed the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candles burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever will
  She's been my queen since we were sixteen
We want the same things
We dream the same dreams
Alright, alright?
I got it all cause she is the one
Her mom calls me love
Her dad calls me son
Alright, alright

Everybody want to steal my girl
Everybody want to take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world

Kisses like a queen, her walk is so lean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans

The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn
Alright, alright?

Couple billion in the whole wide world

  Oh no
The love, the hate
Don't hate this ain't no ordinary life
We give, we take
This ain't no temporary high
The rise, the fall
This shit is messing with my mind
I'm up, the wall
Now I'm running for the lights
Your uh, I'm on, yeah, do this every night
It's right, it's wrong, do this every single time
Oh fuck it, it's on, I just wanna touch the sky
Cos now I see the
White line, and blue skies
Who told you that we can't fly
White line, all the time
Who told you that we can't fly
So far, so good
I'm mad, that's just something that I like
Before, I die, I'm just tryna live my life
Say yes, say no, but you don't have to ask me twice
I'm in, my zone, you know
I want the feeling,
Like I'm breaking through the ceiling
And I just wanna touch the sky, yeah,
Cos now I see the, white line
And blue skies, who told you that we can't fly
White line, all the time
Who told you that we can't fly
-Instrumental-
Soldier, you can fly
Yeah,
White line, and blue skies
Who told you that we can't fly
White line, all the time
Who told you that we can't fly
Oh yeah
White line, and blue skies
Who told you that we can't fly

  Frisse morgen in Parijs
Gewoon m'n business
Ik zie de meest mooie Française, op d'r bung hoge hakken en ik,
Weet niet wat ik zeggen moet
Ik zeg: Bonjour, mon amour
Mademoiselle, tu est très belle
En eh, en zij zegt:
Je suis néerlandaise
Oh
Je parle en tu peux français
En ik zei
Praat Nederlands met me
Even Nederlands met me
Mijn gevoel zegt mij
Dat wij vanavond samen kijken
Naar de Champs-Élyséés
En naar de Notre-Dame en aan de Seine
En daarna samen op la Tour Eiffel
M m m m
M m m
Ah
En ik voelde dat het goed zat
Ik zag haar zo verlegen lachen
Kan niet geloven dat het echt was
Zij de mijne zijn
Ze leek een mix van Doutzen, Edsilia en Anouk
Oh oh oh
Er gebeurde iets met mij, toen zij zei
Je suis néerlandaise
Oh
Je parle en tu peux français
En ik zei
Praat Nederlands met me
Even Nederlands met me
Mijn gevoel zegt mij
Dat wij vanavond samen kijken
Naar de Champs-Élyséés
En naar de Notre-Dame en aan de Seine
En daarna samen op la Tour Eiffel
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Eh oh oh oh m m m
En dan nog een woordje voor ons
Je t'aime
Je t'aime
Je t'aime
Je t'aime
Je t'aime
Je t'aime
Praat Nederlands met me
Even Nederlands met me
Mijn gevoel zegt mij
Dat wij vanavond samen kijken
Naar de Champs-Élyséés
En naar de Notre-Dame en aan de Seine
En daarna samen landen op Schiphol
Ah ah ah yeah
  When you wake up I'll be,
Long gone,
Made the great escape,
Took my heart and run,
There's no returning,
No more burning bridges down,
Phoenix to the bolding flames,
'Cause boy, I'm all cried out,
Over you, over you,
Boy I'm all cried out,
Burning up, burning up, burning all my tears away,
Boy I'm all cried out,
Over you, over you,
Boy I'm all cried out,
Over you, over you,
Boy I'm all cried out,
Over you, over you,
Boy I'm all cried out,
Over you over you,
When you wake up the'll be no sound,
No one left to kiss when you turn around,
I leave my heartbreak in the dark hole of your bed,
With every tear I shed,
Cause boy, I'm all cried out,
Over you, over you,
Boy I'm all cried out,
Burning up, burning up, burning all my tears away,
Cause Boy I'm all cried out,
Over you, over you,
Boy I'm all cried out,
Over you, over you,
And now you've done this to me,
Don't you dare come back,
And if I drove down the street,
I know I won't go back,
And of the time to keep,
I've found a better me,
I feel so sorry for you baby,
Cause boy, I'm all cried out,
Over you, over you,
Boy I'm all cried out,
Over you, over you,
Boy I'm all cried out,
Over you, over you,
Boy I'm all cried out,
Burning up burning yeah
  When I am alone I sit and dream
And when I dream the words are missing
Yes I know that in a room so full of light
That all the light is missing
But I don't see you with me, with me
Close up the windows, bring the sun to my room
Through the door you've opened
Close inside of me the light you see
that you met in the darkness
Time to say goodbye
Horizons are never far
Would I have to find them alone
without true light of my own with you
I will go on ships over seas
that I now know
No, they don't exist anymore
It's time to say goodbye
When you were so far away
I sit alone and dream of the horizon
Then I know that you are here with me, with me
Building bridges over land and sea
Shine a blinding light for you and me
To see, for us to be
Time to say goodbye
Horizons are never far
Would I have to find them alone
without true light of my own with you
I will go on ships over seas
that I now know
No, they don't exist anymore
It's time to say goodbye
so with you I will go
on ships over seas
that I now know
No, they don't exist anymore
It's time to say goodbye
I love you
  When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
When the curtain's call is the last of all
When the lights fade out all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you made
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
  Tell me something, I need to know
Then take my breath and, never let it go
If you just let me, invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby in that moment you'll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta-gotta-gotta-gotta got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta-gotta-gotta-gotta got to love me harder (Love me harder)
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Harder-Harder-Harder
I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me I, tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain
And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I'll make it feel like the first time
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta-gotta-gotta-gotta got to love me harder
(I'mma love you harder)
And if you really need me
You gotta-gotta-gotta-gotta got to love me harder
(Love me harder, lo–love me harder)
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Harder-Harder-Harder (Ooh)
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Harder-Harder-Harder (You gotta love me harder)
What do I do if I can't figure it out? (Figure it out?)
You got to try-try-try again (Ooh)
So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
I'm gonna leave-leave-leave again
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta-gotta-gotta-gotta got to love me harder
(I'mma love you, love you, love)
And if you really need me
You gotta-gotta-gotta-gotta got to love me harder
(Yeah, you gotta love me, Baby)
'Cause if you wanna keep me
You gotta-gotta-gotta-gotta got to love me harder
(Love me harder)
And if you really need me
You gotta-gotta-gotta-gotta got to love me harder
(I'mma do it, do-do it, I'mma love you harder Hey!)
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Love me, love me, love me (I'mma love you)
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Harder-Harder-Harder (Oh Boy you gotta love me, love me, Baby)
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Love me, love me, love me (Just a little bit harder, harder, Baby)
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Harder-Harder-Harder

  Tell me, tell me that you want me
And I'll be yours completely, for better or for worse
I know, we'll have our disagreements
Be fighting for no reason, I wouldn't change it for the world
Cause I knew, the first day that I met you
I was never gonna let you, let you slip away
And I still remember feeling nervous
Trying to find the words to get you here today
You make my heart feel like its summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's how I know that you are the one
That's why I know you are the one
Life is easy to be scared of
With you I am prepared for what is yet to come
Cause our two hearts will make it easy
Joining up the pieces, together making one
You make my heart feel like its summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's how I know you are the one
That's why I know you are the one
When we are together you make me feel like my mind is free
And my dreams are reachable
You know I never ever believed in love or believed one day
That you would come along
Free me
You make my heart feel like its summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when its wrong
That's why I know you are the one
That's how I know you are the one
  Mes chers parents je pars
Je vous aime mais je pars
Vous n'aurez plus d'enfants
Ce soir
Je ne m'enfuis pas je vole
Comprenez bien je vole
Sans fumée sans alcool
Je vole, je vole
Elle m'observait hier
Soucieuse, troublée, ma mère
Comme si elle le sentait
En fait elle se doutait
Entendait
J'ai dit que j'étais bien
Tout à fait l'air serein
Elle a fait comme de rien
Et mon père démuni
A souri
Ne pas se retourner
S'éloigner un peu plus
Il y a à Gard une autre gare
Et enfin l'Atlantique
Mes chers parents je pars
Je vous aime mais je pars
Vous n'aurez plus d'enfants
Ce soir
Je ne m'enfuis pas je vole
Comprenez bien je vole
Sans fumée sans alcool
Je vole, je vole
Je me demande sur ma route
Si mes parents se doutent
Que mes larmes ont coulés
Mes promesses et l'envie d'avancer
Seulement croire en ma vie
Tout ce qui m'est promit
Pourquoi, où et comment
Dans ce train qui s'éloigne
Chaque instant
C'est bizarre cette cage
Qui me bloque la poitrine
Je ne peux plus respirer
Ca m'empêche de chanter
Mes chers parents je pars
Je vous aime mais je pars
Vous n'aurez plus d'enfants
Ce soir
Je ne m'enfuis pas je vole
Comprenez bien je vole
Sans fumée sans alcool
Je vole
Lalalala
Je vole, je vole
  You already know who it is
Silentó
Silentó

Is your heart racing?
Is there fire in your veins?
Are your bones burning?
Is your skin yearning?
'Cause you're driving me insane
I kinda feel like I feel like I saw the light
You got me way up a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Like we're flying in outer space
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that sky?
We're gonna reach it now
Do you feel the lightning inside of you
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Oh oh oh oooh, oh oh oh oooh
Are your hands shaking?
Are your fears breaking?
Are you climbing all the walls?
Are the times changing?
Is the noise fading?
'Cause I wanna get it all
I kinda feel like I feel like I saw the light
You got me way up a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Or are you afraid to fall?

I saw stars on the pavement
California dreams
Looked up through the bright lights
No stars did I see
You said it's all yours if you take it there
I said I can't do it alone I swear
You said it's all yours
It's all yours and you smiled
It's only you (who)
Loves me like you do (do)
Tryna keep it cool (cool)
But I can't keep cool about it
Acting like a fool (fool)
Wanna scream it from the roof (roof)
I'm tryna keep it cool (cool)
But I can't keep cool about it
And for your love I was blind
Drifting at sea
You were the beacon I followed home
You were the one who rescued me
You said it's all yours if you take it there

You said it's all yours
It's all yours and you smiled

But I can't keep cool about it
  I really wanna stop but I just got a taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So, honey, hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel I could die walking up to the room, Oh Yeah
Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really-really-really-really-really-really like you
And I want you
Do you want me?

I really-really-really-really-really-really like you
And I want you
Do you want me?
Do you want me too?
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone, you and me and this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, Baby
Late night watching television

​Dredging up great white sharks, swimming in the bed
​Thrashing the covers off, has me by its teeth
​And oh, my love, remind me
What was it that I said?
​I can't help but pull the earth around me
To make my bed
​And oh, my love, remind me
What was it that I did?
​Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
​Did I build a ship to wreck?
​
​To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
​Did I build this ship to wreck?
​
​What's with the long face?
Do you want more?
​Don't let the curtain catch you, 'cause you've been here before
​The chair is an island, darlin'
You can't touch the floor
​
​And oh, my love, remind me
What was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me
To make my bed
And oh, my love, remind me
What was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
Good God, under starless skies we are lost
​And into the breach we got tossed
​And the water's coming in fast
​
​And oh, my love, remind me
What was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me
To make my bed
And oh, my love, remind me
What was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
  All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said "Show me something"
He said "If you dare, come a little closer"
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh-Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way, I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh-Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way, I want you to stay
Ooh, Ooh-Ooh the reason I hold on
Ooh, Ooh-Ooh 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the lights
It's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way, I want you to stay
Hey-Hey, Hey, stay, Aye-Aye-Aye-Aye
I want you to stay, Ooh-Ooh

  Spending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again
And trying to forget you is just a waste of time
Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you
All day long, wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here
Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you
Now that I put it all together
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart?
Nothing left for me, ain't there nothing left for me
Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, listen baby, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you
I was wrong, and I just can't live
Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
  In a perfect storybook, the world is brave and good
A hero takes your hand, a sweet love will follow
But life's a different game, the sorrow and the pain
Only you can change your world tomorrow
Let your smile light up the sky
Keep your spirit soaring high
Trust in your heart and your sun shines forever and ever
Hold fast to kindness, your light shines forever and ever
I believe in you and me
We are strong
When 'once upon a time,' in stories and in rhyme
A moment you can shine and wear your own crown
Be the one that rescues you
Through the clouds, you'll see the blue
Trust in your heart and your sun shines forever and ever
Hold fast to kindness, your light shines forever and ever
I believe in you and me
We are strong
A bird all alone on the wind (?)
Can still be strong and sing
Sing
Trust in your heart and your sun shines forever and ever
Hold fast to kindness, your light shines forever and ever
I believe in you and me
We are strong
Standing in a crowded room and I can't see your face
Put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
In my mind, I'm running round a cold and empty space
Just put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh
The rising tide will rise against them all, oh
Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?
Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand? Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand
Soul is like a melting pot when you're not next to me
Tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
Tryna find a moment where I can find release
Please tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh
The rising tide will rise against them all, oh
Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?
Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand? Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand
Don't wanna know
That feeling when I'm all alone
So please don't make me wait, cause I don't wanna break
And I don't wanna fall
When you're next to me
Can tell I'm not afraid to be
That you don't make me wait, and never let me break
You never let me fall
Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?
Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand? Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand

Ah-la-la-la-la
I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets until the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How? I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
  Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go, and you let her go
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch, Oh it dies
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go, Oh-Whoa, Oh No
And you let her go, Oh-Whoa, Oh No
Well you let her go
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go, and you let her go
  Everyday when you're walking down the street
And everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view
And I say HEY! (HEY!)
If you can learn to work and play
And get along with each other
You got to listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm
The rhythm of the street
Open up your eyes
Open up your ears
Get together and make things better
By working together!
It's a simple message and it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself (in yourself)
cause that's the place to start (to start)
And I say HEY! (HEY!)
What a wonderful kind of day
If we can learn to work and play
Hey what a wonderful kind of day hey!
  My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt can you hear them cryin'?
Can you practice what you preach?
Would you turn the other cheek?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
And can you feel the love tonight?
Nobody wants to see us together
But it don't matter no
Cause I got
Country Roads, take me home
To the place I belong
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Oh I can't live
With or without you
Pictures of you, pictures of me,
Hung upon your wall for the world to see
And she will be loved
Yeah she will be lo,
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
No woman, no cry
Yeah mama this surely is a dream
I come from a land down under
Red, white and blue
The funny things you do
America, America oh this is you
They say that Taylor was a good girl
Never want to be late, complain
Express ideas in her brain
I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to your baby)
Take on me (When I come around)
Take me on (When I come around)
I'll be gone, in a day or two
Save tonight (Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you)
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow (There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do)
Tomorrow I'll be gone (If I were a boy)
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces (I think I would understand)
Can't deny, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
In my head, I see you all over me
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy
In my head
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
What if God was one of Us?
Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody
I know she's playing with me
well that's ok cause I got no self esteem
With a thousand lies
And a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes
Hit 'em right between the eyes
You're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
Too late to apologize
Too late
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
Come on Barbie, let's go party
How long, how long will I slide
Separate my
Double rainbow all the way across the sky
Yeah, yeah, so intense
Enjoy yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted
Time to say goodbye
veduto vissuto con te
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
I'm more than a bird I'm more than a plane
I'm a birdplane, I'm a birdplane
A motherfucking birdplane
Doesn't that sound familiar
Doesn't that hit too close to home
Doesn't that make you shiver
The way that things have gone
And doesn't that seem peculiar
'Cause everyone wants a little more
And something I do remember
To never go this far
That's all it takes to be a star
  The light is fading now
My soul is running on a puff
That I cannot reach
My brain is turnin'
And my head is hurtin'
Every day a little bit more
The light is fading now
My forces is being sucked by
A ¿bloody leach?
My fear is smilin'
And my threat is singin'
Every night a little bit more
I cannot see anything
I am blindfolded
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
It's about to cry
I'm a zombie
I don't know what to do
I should be done in the place
But I gotta stay, stay stay
Stay stay stay stay
I'm so lonely
I don't know if I get through
I wanna be floating in space
But I gotta stay, stay stay
Stay stay stay stay
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
It's about to cry
  Want to Want Me/I Want You To Want Me Mashup
It's too hard to sleep,
I got the sheets on the floor,
Nothin' on me,
And I can't take it no more,
It's a hundred degrees,
I got one foot out the door,
Where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave,
In the back of the cab,
I tip the driver, 'head of time,
Get me there fast,
I got your body on my mind,
I want it bad,
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
Boy you're the one I want to want me,
And if you want, then boy, you've got me,
There's nothing I, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do,
Just to get up next you
Boy you're the one I want to want me,
And if you want, then boy you've got me,
There's nothing I, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do,
Just to get up next you
Just to get up next you
You open the door,
Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the floor,
And you whisper in my ear baby I'm yours,
Ooh just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
Boy you're the one I want to want me,
And if you want then boy you've got me,
There's nothing I, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do,
Just to get up next you
Boy you're the one I want to want me,
And if you want then boy you've got me,
There's nothing I, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do,
Just to get up next you

I need you to need me,
I'd love you to love me,
I'm begging you to beg me
(I want you to want me)
Boy you're the one I want to want me,
(I need you to need me)
And if you want, then boy you've got me,
(I'd love you to love me)
There's nothing I,

I wouldn't do,
I wouldn't do,
Just to get up next to you
(I want you to want me)
Boy you're the one I want to want me,
(I need you to need me)
And if you want, then boy you've got me,
(I'd love you to love me)
There's nothing I,
(I'm begging you to beg me)
I wouldn't do,
I wouldn't do
  Life is like a big merry-go-round,
You're up and then down,
Everybody's been counting you out,
Where are they now?
Sitting in the same old place,
We all make mistakes,
You might fall on your face,
But you gotta get up!
I'd rather stand tall
Than live on my knees,
'Cause I am a conqueror,
And I won't accept defeat!
Try telling me no,
One thing about me
Is I am a conqueror,
I am a conqueror!
Ooh oh
Got a vision that no one else sees,
Lot of dirty work, roll up your sleeves,
Remember there's a war out there,
So come prepared to fight!
You never know where the road leads you,
Not everyone's gonna believe you,
I'd rather stand tall (tall)
Than live on my knees (can't live on my knees)
'Cause I am a conqueror
And I won't accept defeat!
Try telling me no (no)
One thing about me (one thing about me)
Is I am a conqueror,

Ooh oh (Ooh oh)
I am a conqueror!

But you gotta get up!
We all make mistakes,
You might fall on your face,
Don't ever give up!
I'd rather stand tall (oooh)
Than live on my knees (can't live on my knees)
'Cause I am a conqueror (I am a conqueror)
And I won't accept defeat! (And I won't accept defeat)
Try telling me no (try telling me no)
One thing about me (one thing about me)
Is I am a conqueror (is I am a conqueror)
I am a conqueror!
Ooh oh (Ooh oh)
I am a conqueror!
We all make mistakes,
You might fall on your face,
But I am a conqueror!

Believe me, I could live without you
But I really don't want to
Believe me, I could love without you
But I really don't need to
'cause leavin' is the hardest thing to do
But being left is hard, oh yes, it's true
But you're coming back
How do I get back to you?
To You x10
  I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
Get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous
Ask me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Ask how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often
Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the G-Class Grain, matted
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter
That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder
She's just happy that the crew's back in town
She's 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder
Oooh, the sun's risin' up
The night's almost up
The night's almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again
Girl, I'll go again
Girl, I'll go again
  Right from the start you were a thief you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep, Oh-Oh
Things you never say to me, Oh-Oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought, that we were fine (Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My Dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind (Yeah, but this is happening)
You've been having real bad dreams, Oh-Oh
You used to lie so close to me, Oh-Oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love, Oh-Oh, our love, our love, love!
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Oh, tear ducts and rust! I'll fix it for us!
We're collecting dust, but our love's enough
You're holding it in! You're pouring a drink!
No, nothing is as bad, as, it, seems, we'll come clean!
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Oh-Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh-Oh-Oh, can learn to love again
Oh-Oh, that we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurts
I don't want it, I gotta, gotta have it, uh oh
When I can finds the word I just go
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it
All out, turn the beat up

  All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
California dreamin' on such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
California dreamin' on such a winter's day
I stopped into a church I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees and I pretended to pray
You know the preacher liked the cold, he knows I'm gonna stay
California dreamin' on such a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
If I didn't go, I could leave today
California dreamin' on such a winter's day
Oh such a winter's day
On such a winter's day
Yanım çok kalabalık sesin gelmiyor bağır
Müzik son ses bangır bangır
Ağzı bozuk şarkılar tuttum sana biraz ağır
Haydi, haydi saldır saldır
Gül gibi uyuyan yılanı uyandırdın
Garanti bildin beni, havalandın
Yürek yemiş sanki mübarek
Neyine güvendin evladım?
Gül gibi uyuyan yılanı uyandırdın
Garanti bildin beni havalandın
Adın bensiz buralarda etkisiz eleman, sıfır aldın
Yavrum kaldır kollarını
Teslim ol etrafın sarılı
Sabret af çıksın sana
Ben öptürcem bu evin yollarını
Yavrum kaldır kollarını
Teslim ol etrafın sarılı
Bunlar iyi günler
Ben sana gösterecem kıvrak oyunlarımı
Yanım çok kabalık sesin gelmiyor, bağır
Müzik son ses bangır bangır
Ağzı bozuk şarkılar tuttum sana biraz ağır
Haydi, haydi saldır saldır
Gül gibi uyuyan yılanı uyandırdın
Garanti bildin beni, havalandın
Yürek yemiş sanki mübarek
Neyine güvendin evladım
Gül gibi uyuyan yılanı uyandırdın
Garanti bildin beni havalandın
Adın bensiz buralarda etkisiz eleman, sıfır aldın
Gül gibi uyuyan yılanı uyandırdın
Garanti bildin beni havalandın
Adın bensiz buralarda etkisiz eleman, sıfır aldın
  I see what you're wearing, there's nothing beneath it
Forgive me for staring, forgive me for breathing
We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds
Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now, we're beautiful (x2)
Wherever it's going, I'm gonna chase it
What's left of this moment, I'm not gonna waste it
Stranded together, our worlds have collided
This won't be forever, so why try to fight it?
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds
Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now, we're beautiful (x2)
Let's live tonight like fireflies
And one by one light up the sky
We disappear and pass the crown
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds
Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now, we're beautiful (x2)
  I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh no no don't leave me alone lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
So tell me when it kicks in
I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted
Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way
To the father son and holy spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believing in
But if you spit on my fucking grave
And wish me Hell then I wish you well
I'mma send you straight up to my best friend
God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the lama
But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace
Though maybe not fit to enter
The priesthood, but at least should
Make an attempt to show some remorse
Than to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher
In the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I get attacked
So I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap
Well, what I have to say on the mic then you
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap cause I'm a sinner
(I got a best friend, best friend)
My balls and intestines
They ain't never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever giving it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming
Cause failure's something I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my guts
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nothin'
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)
Who you think I'm talking 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend)
Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power
Now when I blackout, power outage, stop
They powerless but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds to black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You be D-O-A, then announced
They pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shigy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the digy-Doc
Stigy-stopping and that's not an option
Something I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in the suit
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock and I shoot
Who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And they be waiting at the gate
When you get sprayed up, sending you hoes straight up
To deal with my (best friend)

  Oh, won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride if you can keep a secret
Oh, won't you stay for a while?
Show me darkness baby, show me demons
Oh, won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride if you can keep a secret
Stay a while, stay a while
And I will make it worth your while, worth your while
Stay a while, stay a while
And I'mma go the extra mile, extra mile
Boy, if you wait until the lights go down
I got some tricks that help you scream it out
So stay a while, stay a while
And I'mma make it worth your while, worth your while
(Oh, won't you stay for a while?)
(Oh, won't you stay for a while, for a while?)
(Oh, won't you stay for a while?)
(Oh, won't you stay for a while, for a while?)
Oh, won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride if you can keep a secret
  Break it off here
Break-break it off there
Now bounce your knees back
Back ang forward
And if you doing it right
Your hips will be doing the same thing
Love, fresh out the oven
Straight sugar lovin
To the beat a lovin
Hey
You wanna
Break it off here
Break-break it off there
  I faced a mountain,
That I never faced before
That's why I'm calling on the Lord
I know it's been awhile,
But Lord please hear my prayer
Sometimes it takes a mountain
Sometimes a troubled sea
Sometimes it takes a desert
To get a hold of me
Your Love is so much stronger
Then whatever troubles me
Sometimes it takes a mountain
To trust you and believe
Forgive me, Jesus
I thought I could control
Whatever life would throw my way
But this I will admit
Has brought me to my knees
I need you Lord and I'm not ashamed to say
Sometimes it takes a mountain
Sometimes a troubled sea
Sometimes it takes a desert
To get a hold of me
Your Love is so much stronger
Then whatever troubles me
Sometimes it takes a mountain
To trust you and believe
Sometimes it takes a mountain
To trust you and believe
  Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh!
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh!
Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never wanna put my heart on the line
But swimming in your world is something spiritual
I'm born again every time you spend the night
Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh!
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
Ooh!
You bring me to my knees
You make me testify
You can make a sinner change his ways
Open up your gates cause I can't wait to see the light
And right there is where I wanna stay
Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't I just stay here
Spend the rest of my days here
Oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't I just stay here
Spend the rest of my days here
Cause you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh!
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh!
  Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep
Heart ache, heart break
All over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more
Keep them coming
Cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
These are the days we've been waiting for
Raddle the cage and slam that door
And the world is calling us but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
Out on the midnight
The wild ones howl
The last of the lost boys who've thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of time
Time flew, cut through
All over town
You make me bleed when I look up and you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together
These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more
Keep them coming
Cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store
You just roll your windo down and place your bets
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we'll never forget
And these are the days
And these are the days
  I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in, the chemicals, Yeah
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, Whoa
I'm waking up I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-I'm
Radioactive, Radioactive
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-I'm
Radioactive, Radioactive
I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution I suppose
We'll paint it red, to fit right in, Whoa (Whoa)
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, Whoa
I'm waking up I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-I'm
Radioactive, Radioactive
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-I'm
Radioactive, Radioactive
All systems go, sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside
I'm waking up I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-I'm

  Jag vet att du sover
Känner värmen från din hud
Bara lukten gör mig svag
Men jag vågar inte väcka dig nu
Jag skulle ge dig
Allting du pekar på
Men bara när du inte hör
Vågar jag säga så
Jag kan inte ens gå
Utan din luft i mina lungor
Jag kan inte ens stå
När du inte ser på
Och genomskinlig grå blir jag
Utan dina andetag
Min klocka har stannat
Under dina ögonlock
Fladdrar drömmarna förbi
Inuti är du fjäderlätt och vit
Och utan ett ljud
Mitt hjärta i din hand
Har jag tappat bort mitt språk
Det fastnar i ditt hår
Jag kan inte ens gå
Utan din luft i mina lungor
Jag kan inte ens stå
När du inte ser på
Och färglös som en tår blir jag
Utan dina andetag
Jag kan inte ens gå
Utan din luft i mina lungor
Jag kan inte ens stå
Om du inte ser på
Och genomskinlig grå
Vad vore jag
Utan dina andetag
Vad vore jag
Utan dina andetag
OH!
OH!
(oh!) Hjärtat vill slå, men baby förlåt!
Det brinner i bröstet varje dag, snälla be mig inte stanna kvar,
Vi blev inte bra för varandra, tog varandra förgivet,
dem säger, att tiden läker alla sår, men livet lämnar alltid spår,
så delar av det som vi va finns alltid kvar!
OH!
OH!
(oh!) Hjärtat vill slå, men baby förlåt!
Varje gång jag minns tillbaka, på allt jag kommer sakna,
ha dig under mina lakan, hur dina läppar smaka,
Vakna bredvid dig girl, va allt jag levde för,
I nöd och lust är vad vi en gång sa (sa),
ingenting är som det en gång va (va),?????????????,
men nej jag kan ej stanna, jag måste dra,
det är väl du och jag med mig (hej hej hej)
Mitt hjärta gråter (jag saknar dig)
Det skulle va vi två från skillda världar,
OH!
OH!
(oh!) Hjärtat vill slå, men baby förlåt!
Det brinner i bröstet varje dag, snälla be mig inte stanna kvar,
(oooh, yeah yeah) Snälla be mig inte stanna kvar,
  Yeah, you never said a word
You didn't send me no letter
Don't think I could forgive you
See, our world is slowly dying
I'm not wasting no more time
Don't think I could believe you
Yeah, you never said a word
You didn't send me no letter
Don't think I could forgive you
See, our world is slowly dying
I'm not wasting no more time
Don't think I could believe you
Yeah, our hands will get more wrinkled
And our hair will be grey
Don't think I could forgive you
And see the children are starving
And their houses were destroyed
Don't think they could forgive you
Hey, when seas will cover lands
And when man will be no more
Don't think you can forgive you
Yeah, when there'll just be silence
And when life will be over
Don't think you will forgive you
Yeah, you never said a word
You didn't send me no letter
Don't think I could forgive you
See, our world is slowly dying
I'm not wasting no more time

Yeah, our hands will get more wrinkled
And our hair will be grey
Don't think I could forgive you
And see the children are starving
And their houses were destroyed
Don't think they could forgive you
Hey, when seas will cover lands
And when man will be no more
Don't think you can forgive you
Yeah, when there'll just be silence
And when life will be over
Don't think you will forgive you
  Hope when you take that jump
You don't feel the fall
Hope when the water rises
You built a wall
Hope when the crowd screams out
They're screaming your name
Hope if everybody runs
You choose to stay
Hope that you fall in love
And it hurts so bad
The only way you can know
You gave it all you had
And I hope that you don't suffer
But take the pain
Hope when the moment comes,
You'll say
I, I, I
I did it all
I, I, I
I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places, the things that I did
Yeah with every broken bone
I swear I lived
Hope that you spend your days
But they all add up
And when that sun goes down
Hope you raise your cup
Oh, oh oh
I wish that I could witness
All your joy
And all your pain
But until my moment comes
I'll say
I, I, I
I did it all
I, I, I
I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places, the things that I did
Yeah with every broken bone
I swear I lived
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh (x4)
With every broken bone
I swear I lived
With every broken bone
I swear I
I, I, I
I did it all
I, I, I
I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places, the things that I did
Yeah with every broken bone
I swear I lived
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh (x2)
I swear I lived
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh (x2)
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen
American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American Oxygen
Oh say can you see, this is the American Dream
Young girl, hustlin'
On the other side of the ocean
You can be anything at all
In America, America
I say, can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe
Oh say can you see, this is the American Dream
Young boy, hustlin'
Tryna get the wheels in motion
But he can be anything at all
In America, America
I say, can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe
This is the new America
We are the new America
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don't like it when you and I getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
I'm not a rapper just a singer with a game plan
I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand
80,000 people in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming "Who want what?"
Now, please be warned
That every song I feature on has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type
Now I'm in the lime light
Tryna get my mind right
Body clock is in the clouds so often guess it's high time
Hoodie sing the line like
I'm not a singer, I just rap pretty
So now my fan base is full of Megan's and Ashley's
And they're wondering if there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like, "Naturally, baby, let me find a spot in the front"
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, we can pretend
Oh, typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to Paula my patent
Young prince of Manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien Broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and Revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is Yeezus
One for the money
Two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold, not everybody is winning
I'm Larry David plus Miles Davis
So, everybody hating and fuck it, I hardly blame 'em
And they don't know anything about us
Or anything about us
Or anything about it
No, no, no
  Dead inside!
Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share
Unleash a million drones
And confine me then erase me babe
Do you have no soul
It's like it died long ago
Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
On the outside you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside
You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverised
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go
You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinity
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft
Your skin feels warm to caress
I see magic in your eyes
On the outside you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside!
Feel me now
Hold me please
I need you to see who I am
Open up to me
Stop hiding from me
It's hurting babe
Only you can stop the pain
Don't leave me out in the cold
Don't leave me out to die
I gave you everything
I can't give you anymore
Now I've become just like you
My lips feel warm to the touch
My words seem so alive
My skin is warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotise
You've taught me to lie
Without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
Now I'm dead inside!

  My house in Budapest, my hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano, my beautiful Castillo
For you, you, I'd leave it all
My acres of a land, I have achieved
It may be hard for you to stop and believe
But for you, you, I'd leave it all
Give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me, then all of this will go away
My many artifacts, the list goes on
If you just say the words, I'll up and run
Oh, to you, you, I'd leave it all
Give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me, then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me, then all of this will go away
My friends and family, they, don't understand
They fear they'd lose so much if you took my hand
But, for you, you, I'd lose it all
Give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me, then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me, then all of this will go away
My house in Budapest, my hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano, my beautiful castillo
For you, you, I'd leave it all, you, you, I'd leave it all
  The day we met
frozen, I held my breath
right from the start
knew that I found a home
for my heart,
Beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid
To fall
Watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died everyday
waiting for you
Darlin' don't be afraid
I have loved you for a
Thousand years,
Love you for a
Thousand more
Time stands still
beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything
Take away
Standing in front of me
Every breath,
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died everyday
Waiting for you
Darlin' don't be afraid
I have loved you for a
Thousand years,
Love you for a
Thousand more
All along I believed
I would find you
Time has brought
Your heart to me
I have loved you for a
Thousand years,
Love you for a
Thousand more,
Love you for a
Thousand more
One step closer
I have died everyday
Waiting for you
Darlin' don't be afraid,
I have loved you for a
Thousand years,
Love you for a
Thousand more
All along I believed
I would find you
Time has brought
Your heart to me
I have loved you for a
Thousand years,
Love you for a
Thousand more
  It's the hard-knock life for us
It's the hard-knock life for us
Steada treated,
We get tricked
Steada kisses,
We get kicked
It's the hard-knock life!
Don't it feel like the wind is always howlin?
Don't it seem like there's never any light??
Once a day, don't you wanna throw the towel in?
It's easier than puttin' up a fight
No one's there when your dreams at night get creepy
Empty belly life!
Rotten smelly life!
Full of sorrow life!
No tomorrow life!
Santa Claus what's that? Who's he?
No one cares for you a bit
When you're in an foster kid
It's the hard-knock life
(Make my bathroom shine
but don't touch my medicine cabinet!)
It's the hard-knock life for us
It's the hard-knock life for us
Steada treated,
We get tricked
Steada kisses,
We get kicked
It's the hard-knock life for us
It's the hard-knock life for us
No one cares for you a bit
When you're in an foster kid
(It's the hard-knock life!)
  Hay mentiras en los labios
Hay mentiras en la piel, que dolor
Hay mentiras, hay amantes
Que por instantes de placer
Ponen su vida a temblar
Hay mentiras compasivas
Hay mentiras por piedad
Que no quieren lastimar
Hay mentiras que nos hieren de verdad
Ay, ay, ay
Hay engaños que por años
Ocultaron la verdad
Haciendo mucho daño
Ay, yo me voy a refugiar
A la tierra de tu amor (mi verdad)
Tú eres mi amor, mi alegría
La verdad de mi vida
Mi bebe que me salta a los brazos de prisa
Tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad
Oye, tú eres mi amor, mi alegría
La verdad de mi vida
Mi bebe que me calma el alma con risas
Tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad
Hay mentira en la mirada
Hay mentiras en la piel, dibujadas
Hay mentiras, hay amantes
Que por instantes de placer
Ponen su vida a temblar
Hay doctrinas y oradores
Dictadores sin piedad
Que gobiernan sin verdad
Y hay mentiras en los diarios, en las redes
Y en el mar, ay ay ay
Hay engaños que por años
Ocultaron la verdad
Hiriendo de dolor
Ay, yo me voy a refugiar
Al oasis de tu amor
Tú eres mi amor, mi alegría
La verdad de mi vida
Mi bebe que me salta a los brazos de prisa
Tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad
Oye, tú eres mi amor, mi alegría
La verdad de mi vida
Mi bebe que me calma el alma con risas
Tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad
En un mundo tan irreal
No sé qué creer
Y amor sé que tú eres mi verdad, eres mi verdad
Tú eres la luz que me guía
Tú eres la voz que me calma
Tú eres la lluvia de mi alma
Y eres toda mi verdad
Tú eres la luz de mi vida
Tú eres la voz que me calma
Tú eres la lluvia de mi alma
Y eres toda mi verdad
Eres toda mi verdad
Vet att du inte är bra för mig
tror jag behöver dig ändå
vi träffas har sex i bland
du ringer ditt ex i bland, vad fan händer
Båda vet nog att vi träffar andra
men vi blundar när vi gör det med varandra
tar emot när du ber mig att stanna
går jag hem så ringer du till någon annan
Kan inte få det till sakna dig
ändå är det dig jag tänker på
såklart det blir fel i bland
speciellt när vi ser varann med nån annan
Du vill ha nåt som håller i längden
men du vet att vi gjorde det bättre
går därifrån för jag kan inte se dig
Nu står vi här, hur fan gör vi nu
när alla våra lögner är slut
och det vi håller på med är sjukt
men ingen annan rör mig som du
nej ingen annan rör mig som du
Jag vill inte ta på dig, va med dig
jag vill bara ta på dig, va med mig
lilla baby känns det ensamt nu
jag kan ångra ibland att vi fucka ur
Vi ser inte solen
ingen sand mellan tårna
ingen fucking semester
men vi vill inte jobba
Det känns som vi går där med ångest tillsammans och väntar på sommarn
vem bryr sig om vintern, om våren, om hösten, det funkar på sommarn
vi bråkar, vi skriker, vi knullar, vi blundar tillsammans och somnar
men när ska vi vakna?
Nu står vi här, hur fan gör vi nu
när alla våra lögner är slut
och det vi håller på med är sjukt
men ingen annan rör mig som du
nej ingen annan rör mig som du
För alla våra lögner är slut
och det vi håller på med är sjukt
men ingen annan rör mig som du
nu står vi här, hur fan gör vi nu
Om vi fann en dröm, var den redan dömd, förlåt
men du vill ändå ge det en chans och jag undrar hur tänker du nu
du har redan glömt, vi är bara lögn, förlåt
men en ganska viktig detalj är jag inte känner som du
om det fanns en dröm, var den redan dömd, förlåt
och vi båda vet det är sant
Nu står vi här, hur fan gör vi nu
när alla våra lögner är slut
och det vi håller på med är sjukt
men ingen annan rör mig som du
nej ingen annan rör mig som du
För alla våra lögner är slut
och det vi håller på med är sjukt
men ingen annan rör mig som du
nej ingen annan rör mig som du
Now we're international, so international
International, so international
You can't catch me, boy (can't catch me, boy)
Don't test me, boy (don't test me, boy)
Cause I rap with the best for sure
305 till the death of me
Cremate my body and let the ocean have what's left of me
But for now, forget about that
Blow the whistle
Baby you're the referee
Dale
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Ohh, girl, this international love (international)
Ohh, this international love
I don't play football but I've touched down everywhere
Everywhere? Everywhere!
I don't play baseball but I've hit a home run everywhere, everywhere
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed
In Romania she pulled me to the side
And told me, Pit you can have me and my sister
In Lebanon, yeah the women the bomb
And in Greece, you've guessed it, the women are sweet
Been all around the world but I ain't gon' lie
There's nothing like Miami's heat
Dale
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Ohh, girl, this international love (we're international, that's right)
Ohh, this international love
I ain't talking credit cards if you know what I mean
Yeah, en Cuba, la cosa esta dura
But the woman get down, if you know what I mean
In Colombia the women got everything done
But they are some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil they're freaky with big old booties
And their thongs, blue, yellow and green
Besitos para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah
Y en Miami tengo a cualquiera
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Ohh (all around the world), this international love (international)
Ohh, this international love
There's not a place that your love don't affect me baby
So don't ever change
I cross the globe when I'm with you, baby
Let's ride
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep (212)
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy (310)
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat (305)
Ohh, this international love (international, that's right)
Ohh, this international love
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep (212)
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy (310)
Hotter than Miami

Oooooooooooh (you're international, so international)
Wah-wah-ooh-wah-wah-ooh, international love
(surrounded by beautiful girls)
Wah-wah-ooh-wah-wah-ooh, international love
  Under the glow of the very bright lights
I turn my face towards the warm night skies
And I am not afraid of a thousand eyes
And there above five hundred smiles
Oh I used to think What wouldn't I give
For a moment like this This moment, this gift!
Now look at me and this opportunity
It's standing right in front of me
But one thing I know
It's only part luck and so
I'm putting on my best show!
Under the spotlight
I'm starting my life
Big dreams becoming real tonight
So look at me and this opportunity
You're witnessing my moment, you see?
My big opportunity
And now I'm right here and it time
Because this is real, this is real and it's all mine
I'm not afraid, afraid to fly
When it's above five hundred smiles
Oh I used to think
What I wouldn't give
For a moment like this?
This moment is gift
And, now look at me
And this opportunity
Is standing right in front of me
But one thing I know
It's only part luck and so
I'm putting on my best show
Under the spotlight
I'm starting my life
Big dreams becoming real tonight
So, look at me and this opportunity
You're witnessing my moment, see?
My big opportunity
I won't waste it
I guarantee
  I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I've spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I've spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I've spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunning
And all of my cars start with the push up a button
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now ask me who they want
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I've spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
(It's Iggy-Iggs!)
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
(Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty!
Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia 'round to LA
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Just you watch, they're so predictable
(The girls roll up)
Windows roll down
(Eyes on us)
Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go)
It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!)
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!
Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, "Hey, baby!"
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
Damn, still killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But B and Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time
Iggs
  Tough girl in the fast lane
No time for love
No time for hate
No drama
No time for games
Tough girl whose soul aches
I come home
On my own
Check my phone
Nothing, though
Act busy
Order in
Pay TV
It's agony
I may cry ruining my make up
Wash away all things you've taken
I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
Tough girl
I'm in pain
It's lonely at the top
Block outs and airplanes
I still pour you a glass of champagne
Tough girl whose soul aches
I come home
On my own
Check my phone
Nothing, though
Act busy
Order in
Pay TV
It's agony
I may cry ruining my make up
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
I wake up I wake up I wake up
I wake up I wake up I wake up,alone
I may cry ruining my make up
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
  Some people want me to be heads or tails
I say no way, try again, another day
I should be happy, not tipping the scales
I just won't lay letting my life get away
I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower
I don't take things as they come
If they bring me down
Life can be cruel if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun
Don't tell me what could be done
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame
What you wanna, what you gonna do?
You know you like it but it drives you insane
Tell me cause you know that you wanna feel the same
You know you like it but it drives you insane
What you wanna, what you gonna do?
If you wanna train me, I get animal
Better keep your eye on my every move
There's no need to be, so damn cruel
Baby you got nothing to prove
I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower
I don't take things as they come
If they bring me down
Life can be cruel if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun
Don't tell me what could be done
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame

You and I get so damn dysfunctional we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah I know that we can't do this no more
But baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go, ooh

And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid, crawling back to you
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
Try to tell you no, but my body keeps on telling you yes
Try to tell you stop, but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up feeling satisfied but guilty as hell
But baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go, ooh
Got you stuck on my body, on my body, like a tattoo

( Fito Blanko )
Bailando ! En la pista Sudando !
Tu me estas Calen tando !
We grindin, on the dance floor we whinin
Tell the DJ to rewind it,
Ella tiene tiempo des estar Bailando
El mismo ritmo y desea un cambio
La musica que tu cantabas paso
Una buena cancion pa bailar pegadito
En el vip revolcada con Fito
Si Te Agarro no te voy a dejar
Ella esta soltera y por eso
Vomo Alla
Yeee y yeee
Ella Sigue Bailando
Al compas del tambor
Su corazon caminando
Su alma brillando
La luna cantando
Yeee y yeee
Ella sigue Bailando
Que este party no acaba
Hasta la madrugada
Porque Tu meneito me llama
Ay mi Vida
Desjario
Todo por tu amor
Yo me escapo
Pa olvidar El Dolor
DAME UN MENEO

We grindin, on the dance floor we whinin
Tell the DJ to rewind it,
No te haga que tu eres igual que yo ( yose )
Igual que yo
Oh
Nadie te para los fines de semana
No necesita excusas para una paranda
Tu tienes algo que megusto
Baby Prestamelo
Que yo se guardas un secreto
Despues de un par de trago
Te lo prometo Solo
Un meneito lento
Oh
Mami yo me alegro
Oh
Tan Solo
Un meneito lento
Oh
Yo me alegro
Oh
Ay Mi Vida Dejaria
Todo por tu amor
Pero este noche
Yo me escapo
Pa olvidar El dolor

Lyrics written on notepad by
  Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Will pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
(Here comes Santa Claus)
As we dream by the fire
(Here comes Santa Claus)
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
(Bells are ringing, children singing)
Will pretend that he is Parson Brown
(All is merry and bright)
(Hang your stockings and say your prayers)
Until the other kiddies knock him down
(Cause Santa Claus comes tonight)
When it snows, ain't it thrilling
(Here comes Santa Claus)
Though your nose gets a chilling
(Here comes Santa Claus)
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
(Here comes Santa Claus)
Walking in a winter wonderland
(Santa Claus comes tonight)
When it snows, ain't it thrilling
(Here comes Santa Claus)
Though your nose gets a chilling
(Here comes Santa Claus)
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
Once upon a time in the LBC
Santa came up missing, he was sitting by a tree
His reindeers were near but their leader wouldn't lead
So I took the lead, now as we proceed
This ain't for no mistletoe, but you need to listen, yo
Just in case you didn't know, I call this my Christmas flow
I can take you higher, higher, chestnuts roast on an open fire
Gone away, think that's what the, what the song say
Gone away is the bluebird
(Here comes Santa Claus)
Here to stay is a new bird
(Here comes Santa Claus)
He sings a love song
While we stroll along
(Here comes Santa Claus)
Walking in a winter wonderland
(Cause Santa Claus comes tonight)
A beautiful sight, what we have tonight
(Here comes Santa Claus)
Walking in a winter wonderland
(Cause Santa Claus comes tonight)
Ho, ho, ho
  Dalawa kayo sa buhay ko
At ako ngayon ay kailangan nang mamili
Isa lang ang maaari
Alam mong narito ako
Lagi para sa iyo
Mahal kita ng labis
Ngunit iba ang iyong nais
At siya'y narito
Alay sa ki'y wagas na pag-ibig
Nalilito
Litong litong lito
Sino ang iibigin ko
Ikaw ba na pangarap ko
O siya bang kumakatok sa puso ko
Oh anong paiiralin ko
Isip ba o ang puso ko
Nalilito litong litong lito
Sinong pipiliin ko
Mahal ko o mahal ako
Kahit di ako ang mahal mo
Kung mananatili ako sa yo
Ay baka matutunan mo rin
Na ako'y iyong ibigin
At kung sadyang siya'y tapat
Baka sakaling pagdaan ng araw
Matutunan ko rin ang ibigin siya
Sino ang iibigin ko
Ikaw ba na pangarap ko
O siya bang kumakatok sa puso ko
Oh anong paiiralin ko
Isip ba o ang puso ko
Nalilito litong litong lito
Sinong pipiliin ko
Ang nais ko ay maranasan
Ang umibig at masuklian din ng pag-ibig
Sino ang iibigin ko
Ikaw ba na pangarap ko
O siya ba
Oh anong paiiralin ko
Isip ba o ang puso ko
Nalilito litong litong lito
Litong litong lito
Sinong pipiliin ko
Mahal ko o mahal ako
Everyday I spend my time
Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand
Yes I am
So everyday I spend my time
Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Off again did he go to another dimension my mind
Body, soul imprisoned my eye, probably going ballistic but listen
I'm missing a couple of screws, they ain't never do dreaming true
You been sipping away at the truth, but besides the wisdom I do
Do, do, rolling do, hitting switches, rolling ditches, blowing kisses
To the bitches, hold the biscuits, what's the business
Beat the system, cold defendants, blow the symptoms, go to prison
Go to church and pray to father Lord forgive us
And only God can judge me and he don't like no ugly
I look so fucking good most dykes'll fuck me buddy
Yeah I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her holla if ya need some dick
The devotion its getting hopeless
Behold it I'm getting closest, my soul is I'm seeing ghosts
A solo is now a poet, hypnosis overdose on potions
Adjusting to the motions and getting out all my emotions
This type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got em busting off the clip
In the middle of the office and a message to the bosses
The Misfits new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes, keep the saying that they cost it
For the Porsche's get em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Wanna show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag, Flacko got the brand new rag
That's good news, hood dudes usually don't look like you
How I'm finna get a deal and come back and the whole hood look like you
Screaming "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch I'm legally blind bitch
If I leave or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit niggas copping guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive in getting a piece of the pie
Is to agree with them a lot or just believe a facade bitch
And I'll be fine just drinking my wine bitch
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine
Sipping wine
Taking time slowly
Everyday I spend my time drinking wine
Feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine
Sipping wine
Taking time slowly
  I woke up thinking you were still here
My hands shaking with regret
I've held this dream for such a long long time
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of a wild, to the rhythm of a wild heart
That beats, that beats like a rolling drum
I saw you standing on the corner
I saw you standing on your own
And I get the feeling that it's, it's all a dream
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of a wild, to the rhythm of a wild heart
That beats, that beats like a drum
When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away, I could let them down
But I will remember your light
Your light it follows me in darkness
I'm trying hard but I can't win
And I've played the victim for a long long time
And I wanna grow up
From the rhythm a young, from the rhythm of a younger heart
It leads just like a river runs
That night I sent over the parkway
The summer's gone and I'm alone
And I get the feeling that you're somewhere close
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of your wild, to the rhythm of your wild heart
It beats, been beating since you've gone
When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away, I could let them down
But I will remember
When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away, I could let them down
And I know you're gone but still I will remember your light
And if you see me in the darkness
I hope you know I'm not alone
I carry you with every breath I take
I won't let up, I won't let up
Until the wind is gone
  I miss the taste of the sweet life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, Baby, why did you run away?
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you, ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following-Following-Following to you
The map that leads to you, and nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following-Following-Following
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause all these strangers come over me
Now I can't get over you, no I just can't get over you
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you, ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following-Following-Following to you
The map that leads to you, and nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh
Yeah-Yeah-Yeah, MMM-MMM-MMM
Oh I was there for you, Oh in your darkest times
Oh I was there for you, Oh in your darkest nights
Oh I was there for you, Oh in your darkest times
Oh I was there for you, Oh in your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you, ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following-Following-Following to you
The map that leads to you, and nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following-Following-Following
  (Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh)
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound (Eh, Eh, Eh)
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late (Eh, Eh, Eh)
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late (Eh, Eh, Eh)
(Eh, Eh, Eh)
I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new, Yeah, Yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you but I'm afraid
It's too late to apologize
It's too late (Eh, Eh, Eh)
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late (Eh, Eh, Eh)
Whoa-Whoa-Oh
(Eh, Eh, Eh)
It's too late to apologize
It's too late (Eh, Eh, Eh)
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late (Eh, Eh, Eh)
I said it's too late to apologize, Yeah
I said it's too late to apologize, Yeah
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
  "När min vän sökte min kärlek
En morgon slöjad i grönt
När min vän sökte min kärlek
då doftade blommorna skönt
När min vän vandrade ifrån mig
I solens klämtande glöd
När min vän vandrade i från mig
Var himlen så flammande röd
I nattens dimmor och lysande träd
tystnade fåglarnas sång
Månen förkunnande tiden är slut
Och slog sin silvergong-gong
När min vän vände tillbaka
En morgon slöjad i dis
När min vän vände tillbaka
Var blommorna frusna till is
I nattens dimmor och lysande träd
Tystnade fåglarnas sång
Månen förkunnande tiden är slut
Och slog sin silvergong-gong
När min vän vände tillbaka
En morgon slöjad i dis
När min vän vände tillbaka
Var blommorna frusna till is
Var blommorna frusna till is
Var blommorna frusna till is"
There comes a time
When we hear a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
We can't go on
Pretending day by day
that someone, somehow will soon make a change
We are all a part of
God's great big family
And the truth, you know love is all we need
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
Send them your heart
So they'll know that someone cares
so there cries for help
will not be in vain
We can't let them suffer
no we cannot turn away
Right now they need a helping hand
Nou se mond la
We are the Children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
so lets start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
When you're down and out
There seems no hope at all
But if you just believe
There's no way we can fall
Well, well, well, well, let us realize
That a change can only come
When we stand together as one
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
Got to start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
We are the world
We are the children
Its for the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving

Just you and me

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
Choice were making
saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
We all need somebody that we can lean on
when you wake up look around and see that your dreams gone
when the earth quakes we'll help you make it through the storm
when the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
we are the World united by love so strong
when the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
a guided light on the dark road your walking on
a sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
we are the World connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet sing it along
Everyday citizens
everybody pitching in
Nou se mond la
nou se timoun yo
You and I
You and I
Uh, 12 days no water
wishing will to live
we amplified the love we watching multiply
Feeling like the Worlds end

Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia
and now Haiti needs us, the need us, they need us
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha

  Ta mig tillbaks
Tillbaks till då jag fick min allra första skiva
Cyklade runt och nynnade på Billie Jean
I en värld där vi försvann i 8-bitar
Ta mig tillbaks
Till ett baksäte mot gamla Paris
Det var ett krig med Rosa mil efter mil
Och jag kände mig så liten men så fri
Det var en sommar som aldrig tog slut
För vi levde varenda minut
Ta mig tillbaka
Till när allting var så stort
Ta mig tillbaka
Till innan allt redan var gjort
Man fick vänta
Man fick längta
När tiden var så lång
Ta mig tillbaka
Till dem stunder jag vill känna igen
Ta mig tillbaks
Tillbaks till skogen där vi fann en annan värld
Det var vi som skrev historierna där
Krävdes så lite för att bygga nåt så magiskt
Ta mig tillbaks
Till alla uppenbarelser från MTV
Lika mäktigt som ett stadsfyrverkeri
Tänker tillbaks på hur det var ett annat liv
Det var en sommar som aldrig tog slut
För vi levde varenda minut
Ta mig tillbaka
Till när allting var så stort
Ta mig tillbaka
Till innan allt redan var gjort
Man fick vänta
Man fick längta
När tiden var så lång
Ta mig tillbaka
Till dem stunder jag vill känna igen
Det var en sommar som aldrig tog slut
För vi levde varenda minut
Ta mig tillbaka
Till när allting var så stort
Ta mig tillbaka
Till innan allt redan var gjort
Man fick vänta
Man fick längta
När tiden var så lång
Ta mig tillbaka
Till dem stunder jag vill känna igen
Ta mig tillbaka
Ta mig tillbaka
Stand up like a soldier baby

Tonight we'll let it all go free
Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock inna' di dance

Gubbis jag vill ha en karl i huset, Fy fan vad det smakar,
gubbis jag röker mjöl här, kan du inte köpa ciggaretter åt mig,
jaja det är en dag imorgon
  Saturday morning jumped out of bed
And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'till the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no (No)
Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) Marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) Yeah, no matter what you say
(Marry that girl) And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so, ru-u-ude?
I hate to do this, you leave no choice
I can't live without her
Love me or hate me, we will be both standing at that altar
Or we will run away
To another galaxy you know
You know she's in love with me, she will go anywhere I go
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'till the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer's still no (No)
Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) Marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) No matter what you say
(Marry that girl) And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so, ru-u-ude? Ru-u-ude?
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'till the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but no still means no (No)
Why you gotta be so rude? (Why you gotta be so rude?)
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) Marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) No matter what you say
(Marry that girl) And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so, ru-u-ude? (Yeah-eh, oh-oh)
Why you gotta be so, ru-u-ude? (Yeah-eh-eh)
Why you gotta be so rude?
  Listen to the sound of thunder
Rolling in the soul down under
Far beneath the skin, it rumbles
Step to the step of the drum that rolls inside
Be your enemy or lover
We are put here to discover
Your heart that beats within each other
We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight
And if we die tomorrow
What do we have to show
For the wicked ways down below
The rhythm inside is telling us
We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On the cosmic track, love attack
I'm gonna' get that rhythm back
Be your enemy or brother
We were put here to discover
Your heart that beats within each other
We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight
And if we die tomorrow
What do we have to show
For the wicked ways down below
The rhythm inside is telling us
We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On the cosmic track, love attack
I'm gonna' get that rhythm back
We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight
We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight
We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight
We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight
And if we die tomorrow
What do we have to show
For the wicked ways down below
The rhythm inside is telling us
We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On the cosmic track, love attack
I'm gonna' get that rhythm back
  We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me, there's no place I rather be
I would wait forever, exulted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I rather be (3x)
We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
As long as we're together, there's no place I rather be
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I rather be (3x)
When I am with you, there's no place I rather be
Hmmmmmmmmmm, Hoooooooooo
Be (9x)
Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah, yeah, yeah
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I rather be (3x)
When I am with you, there's no place I rather be
  I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust, you hear my voice
You hear that sound, like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger the fighter
Dancing through the fire 'cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, Louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, you're gonna hear me roar
Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust, you hear my voice
You hear that sound, like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey, got up)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger the fighter
Dancing through the fire 'cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, Louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (You'll hear me roar)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, you're gonna hear me roar
Roar, Roar, Roar, Roar, Roar
I got the eye of the tiger the fighter
Dancing through the fire 'cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, Louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (Yeah)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (You'll hear me roar)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, you're gonna hear me roar

  Nah nah honey, I'm good

I've got somebody at home
It's been a long night here, and a long night there
And these long long legs and damn they're everywhere

You look good, I will not lie
But if you ask where I'm staying tonight
I gotta be like oh baby, no baby, you got me all wrong baby
My baby's already got all of my love
So nah nah Honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I've got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone

I could have another but I probably should not
I've got to bid you adieu
To another I will stay true

True ooo, ooo
Sing it now Oh whoa oh
A new disease in my town called Idiotic
Every pretty lady in my city got it, point blank
Periodically empty seats, dine at Ciprianis
Like Beyoncé, they're getting by or they get embodied
So Sasha Fierce, a whole lot of tears
Rolling down her cheeks, crying till she's sound asleep
Preach, pray that today is not a lonely one
You gotta know you not the only one
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine
We all guilty of the same crime
If you ask me, I might've had a couple women at the same time
But you handle the pressure, Jack Daniels for breakfast
A cap of valium mixed with antidepressants, precious
My momma said that we need love
Till I found out life's a bitch with no prenup, you're on your own
Divorces or court splits, decisions and choices
The Porsche or the fortress? Ignore it or forefeit
  All the life, she has seen
All the meaner side of me
They took away the prophet's dream
For a profit on the street
Now she's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow
All his life, he's been told
He'll be nothing when he's old
All the kicks and all the blows
He will never let it show
Cause he's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That's how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)
All the hurt, all the lies
All the tears that they cry
When the moment is just right
You'll see fire in their eyes
Cause they're stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That's how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power
She's got a lions in her heart
A fire in her soul
He's a got a beast in his belly
That's so hard to control
Cause they've taken too much hits
Taking blow by blow
Now light them up, stand back, watch them explode
She's got a lions in her heart
A fire in her soul
He's a got a beast in his belly
That's so hard to control
Cause they've taken too much hits
Taking blow by blow
Now light them up, stand back, watch them explode
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That's how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power
Ooh yeah
Woah
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's how a superhero learns to fly
  I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
I'm aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
I'm aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead
(Gonna wind up dead)
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you outta my head
(Gotta get you outta my head)
Needle and the thread
(Gotta get you outta my head)
Gonna wind up dead
(Wind up dead)
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you outta my head
Get you outta my head
(You watch me)
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking
Falling onto my knees
(Falling on my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
(I'll be needing stitches)
Tripping over myself
I'm aching
Begging you to come help
(Begging baby please)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
(And now that)
I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
(And now that)
I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
stitches

  He must be up to something
What are the chances? Sure its more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be
They said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here
Look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous?
And he don't even have to say 'owt
Shes in the stance ready to get picked up
  From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you
Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
Oh, this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
And I'll be me
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
And I'll be me
Tryna fit your hand inside mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make it feel all right, no no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now is the time to let it slide
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
And I'll be me
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this dude buggin'
Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more postin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour comes before your dawn
But there was something I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song
  This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up-Up-Up-Up all night long, Oh-Up-Up all night long
You, where did you come from?
You're a different-different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling nu-u-u-umb
Now, I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gu-u-u-un
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a lifetime
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up-Up-Up-Up all night long, Oh-Up-Up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up-Up-Up-Up all night long, Oh-Up-Up all night long (All night long)
I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have a doubt
If I had known where I'd be no-o-o-ow
Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
So I could do this for a lifetime
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up-Up-Up-Up all night long, Oh-Up-Up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up-Up-Up-Up all night long, Oh-Up-Up all night long
Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I ever breathed without you
Baby you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time (One more time)
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up-Up-Up-Up all night long, Oh-Up-Up all night long (Yeah)
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up-Up-Up-Up all night long, Oh-Up-Up all night long (All night long)
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up-Up-Up-Up all night long, Oh-Up-Up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up-Up-Up-Up all night long, Oh-Up-Up all night long
  Det är nu som livet är mitt
Jag har fått en stund här på jorden
Och min längtan har fört mig hit
Det jag saknat och det jag fått
Det är ändå vägen jag valt
min förtröstan långt bortom orden
Som har visat en liten bit
Av den himmel jag aldrig nått
Jag vill känna att jag lever
All den tid jag har
Ska jag leva som jag vill
Jag vill känna att jag lever
Veta att jag räcker till
Jag har aldrig glömt vem jag var
Jag har bara låtit det sova
Kanske hade jag inget val
Bara viljan att finnas kvar
Jag vill leva lycklig för att jag är jag
Kunna vara stark och fri
Se hur natten går mot dag
Jag är här och mitt liv är bara mitt
Och den himmel jag trodde fanns
Ska jag hitta där nånstans
Jag vill känna att jag levt mitt liv
  You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Preset all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these halls
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me
I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
Oh say something, say something
Something like you love me
Unless you wanna move away
From the noise of this place?
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Anything you're trying to say to me
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
  On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oohh, I love the way you lie
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oohh, I love the way you lie, oohh
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories
This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared make-up as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Love the way you lie
  This is just the start of your story
If you got guts you get glory
Anyone can make it even you
In New York City
And now's the time you gota stand tough
Cause if you work hard you can rise up
Anyone can make it even you
In New York City
Look at me I'm just blood pumpin
you and me are two hearts thumpin
We are two souls giving the same feed
So take it all, the city's yours, it's worth fighting for, it's all yours
So take it all, the city's yours, it's worth fighting for, it's all mine,
it's all yours
In New York City
In New York City
In New York City
So put your gloves start trainin
You gotta get wet when it's rainin
If you got heart you can make it too
In New York City
You see what I see look harder
You know we're the same when we start off
Four walks two heads one heart paired
So take it all, the city's yours, ask it for more, when you arrange a tour
So take it all, the city's yours, it's worth fighting for, it's all mine,
it's all yours
In New York City
In New York City
So take it all
So take it all,
the city's yours,

it's all yours
  I feel the water flow as I watch him go
Boy, life is cynical despite my heart of gold

Life changes all of us, it's not your fault, no no no
Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh
Where the sky is blue forever

(Run away
'Til the end of time)
And dear buddy don't you cry when she goes
Cause life is cynical despite your heart of gold
Oh no, buddy don't you cry as they go
Life makes us critical, it all began to change and go

Take a run, take a run with me
'Til the end of time
Life is a dangerous business, you know
Who's gonna care for your bleeding soul?
Take a run, we can all be free
Where the sky is blue forever
  I got my ticket for the long way round
Two bottles of whiskey for the way
And I sure would like some sweet company
And I'm leaving tomorrow, what do you say
When I'm gone, when I'm gone,
When I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me by my hair
You're gonna miss me everywhere, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
  Love, Love, Love, Love, Love
Giving me
Love, love, lo~ve
More than I ever need
Love, you're so distracting
Am I overreacting, For feeling this way
And ever, since I met ya, I can't keep my attention
And you are to blame
Your love's a permanent distraction, a perfect interaction
a feeling so extreme
I lost my appetite to eat, and I barely get to sleep
Cause you're even in my dreams
And I thought that I was strong but I knew that all along,
this was out of my control
So I fell into your hands, and i don't know where we'll land,
I'm just going with the flow
Love, Love, Love, Love, Love
Somedays, I want to run away
This feels so perfect, it's breaking my heart
Yeah we could, we could stay here happy
Or after summer, be two worlds apart
Your love's a permanent distraction, a perfect interaction
a feeling so extreme
I lost my appetite to eat, and I barely get to sleep
Cause you're even in my dreams
And I thought that I was strong but I knew that all along
his was out of my control

So I fell into your hands, and i don't know where we'll land,
I'm just going with the flow
Giving me
Love, Love, Love, Love, Love

(Repeat)
You love how you push me to the point of crazy
And I love when you're on your knees and begging for me
You got me good with all these mind games
There you go, you got my heart again
Say my name, I wanna hear you call
Hold me close, I wanna hear your heart
I'm in a cold sweat and I want you bad
Now you got me all in my head, like damn
I'ma show you how, show you how, show you how
To love again
  One fine day with a woof and a purr
a baby was born and it caused a little stir
no blue bug
and no three-eyed frog
just a feline canine little catdog
catdog
catdog
alone in the world was a little catdog
alone in the world was a little catdog
out on the road or back in town
all kind of critters putting catdog down
gotta rise above it
gotta try to get along
gotta walk together
gotta sing this song
catdog
catdog
alone in the world was a little catdog
catdog
catdog
alone in the world was a little catdog

  Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black day
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose
Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey there is no right way
And so I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
There's an art to life's distractions
Somehow escapes the burning weight the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark thrills of someone else I guess any thrill will do
Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey there is no right way
And so I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new

Cos God knows I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new

  You caused the rain, I brought you pain
But you're the only one that could save me
You caused the rain, I brought you pain
But you're the only one that could save me
Oh save me, please save me
You caused the rain, I brought you pain
But you're the only one that could save me
Oh save me
Sometimes I hit you with a dial tone
You're right but then I say you're wrong
Sometimes I drink too much caffeine
Or go to sleep like I'm Delpo Movin
There's a light, there's a light in your window
There's a light, there's a light in your window
There's a light, there's a light in your window

  inte ett moln
så långt ögat kan nå
inte en droppe regn
på flera dar
med en glass i min mun
å i sandaler av plast
går jag i solen
och tänker på dig
ljusblåa dagar
seglar förbi
Sommaren är kort
de mesta regnar bort
men nu är den här
så ta för dig
solen skiner idag
hösten kommer snart
de går med vindens fart
så lyssna på mig
solen skiner
kanske bara idag
vattnet är varmt
och luften står still
jag sitter i skuggan
läser gårdagens blad
snart är det dags
för ett hopp i de blå
få bort sanden mellan tårna
å svalka min kropp
Sommaren är kort
de mesta regnar bort
men nu är den här
så ta för dig
solen skiner idag
hösten kommer snart
de går med vindens fart
så lyssna på mig
solen skiner
kanske bara idag

  Quando sono solo
sogno all'orizzonte
e mancan le parole
si lo so che non c'è luce
in una stanza quando manca il sole
se non ci sei tu con me, con me
Su le finestre
mostra a tutti il mio cuore
che hai acceso
chiudi dentro me
la luce che
hai incontrato per strada
Con te partirò
paesi che non ho mai
veduto e vissuto con te
adesso si li vivrò
con te partirò
su navi per mari
che io lo so
no no non esistono più
Con te io li rivivrò
Quando sei lontana
sogna all'orizzonte
e mancan le parole
e io si lo so
che sei con me con me
tu mia luna tu sei qui con me
mio sole tu sei qui con me con me
con me con me
Con te partirò
paesi che non ho mai
veduto e vissuto con te
adesso sì le vivrò
con te partirò
su navi per mari
che io lo so
no no non esistono più
con te io li rivivrò
Con te partirò
su navi per mari
che io lo so
no no non esistono più
con te io li rivivrò
con te partirò
Io con te
  Änglarna har åkt på pisk
Gårdarna är grönsvarta
Och i Azalea kan man inte undgå att bli kär
Där går en som svär att allt du gör är gott
Mhm, ja, jag är din
Om du vill ha en idiot lägg din hand i min
Mhm, lägg din hand i min
Har ingen plats att kalla hem
I detta pissiga vårregn
Ett förortsgäng kapar en spårvagn hem
I vårkvällen
Provsmakar livets heroin
Mhm, och om du någonsin
Vill ha en idiot lägg din hand i min
Mhm, lägg din hand i min
Du kanske aldrig når det du vill nå
Men du når mig
Du kanske aldrig får den du vill få
Men du får mig
  It's been a long day without you my friend,
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began,
Why'd you have to leave so soon, yeah,
Why'd you have to go,
Why'd you have to leave me when I needed you the most,
'Cause I don't really know how to tell ya that I'm feeling much worse,
I know you're in a better place but it's always going to hurt,
Carry on,
It's been a long day without you my friend,
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began,
Oooooooooooooooh
How do I breathe without you feeling so cold,
Carry on,
So let the light guide your way, yeah,
Hold every memory as you go,
And every road you take will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you my friend,
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began,
Oooooooooooooooh
When I see you again, see you again, When I see you again
  We are worlds, we are bodies
Empires of dirt and grace
Silhouettes and reflections
Caught in His holy flame
Beneath our skin
A new creation
The night is done
Our chains are broken
The time has come
The wait is over
The King is here
And His Name is Jesus
This is love
Bending skies to heal the broken
This is love
Bleeding life into the grave
Hear the sound
As our hearts cry out forever
Singing hallelujah
Breathing in a brand new world
We are shadows and portraits
Empires of light and clay
Images of our Maker
Sinners called out as saints
Beneath our skin
A new creation
The night is done
Our chains are broken
The time has come
The wait is over
The King is here
And His Name is Jesus
This is love
Bending skies to heal the broken
This is love
Bleeding life into the grave
Hear the sound
As our hearts cry out forever
Singing hallelujah
Breathing in a brand new world
No eye has seen
No ear has heard
No mind conceive
What heaven holds
But here and now
Let earth be found
With all our crowns
Upon Your Name
No eye has seen
No ear has heard
No mind conceive
What heaven holds
But here and now
Let earth be found
With all our crowns
Upon Your Name

Take advantage of tonight
Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai and perform for a princess
But tonight I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless
This is insane, the way the name growin', money keep flowin'
Hustlers move in silence, so I'm tip-toeing to keep blowing
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan
Put it on my life baby
I make you feel right baby
I can't promise tomorrow
But I promise tonight
Dale
Excuse me (Excuse me)

Reach for the stars

At least you fall on top of the world
Think about it
Cuz if you slip, I'm gonna fall on top of your girl (haha)
What I'm involved with is deeper than the masons
Baby baby, and it ain't no secret
My family's from Cuba but I'm an American idol
Getting money like Seacrest

And baby Imma make you feel so good tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow
  Want to, but I can't help it
I love the way it feels,
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
And it's all because,
Never get enough,
She's the sweetest drug
Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done,
Only concern is the next time, I'm gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession wont let me leave
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
And it's all because of you (all because of you) 3X
And it's all because,
Never get enough,
She's the sweetest drug
Ain't no doubt, so strung out 2X
Over you, over you, over you
  I'm drifting through the halls with the sunrise
(Holding on for your call)
Climbing up the walls for that flashing light
(I can never let go)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(But maybe not tonight)
Now the sun is up and I'm going blind
(Holding on for your call)
Another drink just to pass the time
(I can never say no)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(But maybe not tonight)
It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinnin' around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Til Delilah showed me how
Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around
Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of danger in the daylight
(I can never let go)
Took anything to cut you I can find
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of a danger in the daylight
(Can't you let me know?)
Now it's one more boy and it's one more lie
(Holding on for your call)
Taking the pills just to pass the time
(I can never say no)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(But maybe not tonight)
It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinnin' around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Til Delilah showed me how
Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of danger in the daylight
(I can never let go)
Took anything to cut you I can find
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of a danger in the daylight
(Can't you let me know?)
Strung up, strung out for your love
Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
I'm wrung and ringin' out
Why can't you let me know?
Strung up, strung out for your love
Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
I'm wrung and ringin' out
Why can't you let me know?
It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out

  The sun'll come out tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
There'll be sun
Just thinkin' bout tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow
'Till there's none
When I'm stuck with a day
That's gray and lonely
I just stick out my chin and grin
And say
"The sun'll come out tomorrow
So you gotta hang on till tomorrow
Come what may"
Tomorrow, Tomorrow
I love ya, Tomorrow
You're always a day away
When I'm stuck with a day
That's gray and lonely
I just stick out my chin and grin
And say, Oh!
The sun'll come out tomorrow
So you gotta hang on till tomorrow
Come what may
Tomorrow, Tomorrow
I love ya, Tomorrow
You're always a day away
Tomorrow, Tomorrow
I love ya, Tomorrow
You're always a day away
  Like a small boat on the ocean
Sending big waves into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep
And it's been two years
I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
And I still believe
Yeah I still believe
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
A lot of fight left in me
Like a small boat on the ocean
Sending big waves into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Now I've still got a lot of fight left in me
  Everyday they pass me by,
Empty people filled with care,
Headed who knows where?
On they go through private pain,
Laughter hides their silent cries,
When will we realize, people need the Lord?
We are called to take His light
What could be too great a cost
For sharing Life with one who's lost?
Through His love our hearts can feel
They must hear the Words of Life
People need the Lord, people need the Lord
When will we realize that we must give our lives,
  My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground, touch the ground,
And it feels like I can see the sands on the horizon
Everytime you are not around
I'm slowly drifting away, drifting away
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream
I wish I could make it easy, easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, I find a way, I'm stuck here in between,
I'm looking for the right words to say
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream

Niggas got me throwing bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feeling generous, throwing my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love

Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning

She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up
You wanna fuck with a thug

And my niggas, they whipping the bricks
I caught you watching me under the light
Can I be your line?
They say it's easy to leave you behind
I don't wanna try
Cut cover, take that test
Hold courage to your chest
Don't wanna wait for you
Don't wanna have to lose
All that I compromised to feel another high
I've got to keep it down tonight
And oh, oh, oh
I was a king under your control
And oh, oh, oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go
So let me go
Don't you remember how I used to like
Being on the line?
I dreamed you dreamed of me calling out my name
Is it worth the price?
I had to break myself to carry on
No love and no admission
Take this from me tonight
Oh, let's fight (x3)
Let go, let go, let go of everything (x4)
If you want it, take it
I should have said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is, the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is, the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is, the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is, the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
You were better, deeper
I was under your spell
Like a deadly, fever, Yeah, Babe
On the highway to hell, Yeah
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is, the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is, the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is, the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is, the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
(No more, Baby, Ooh-Ooh-Ooh)
Thought of your body I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up, every time, Oh Baby
This is, the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is, the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is (This is), the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is, the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

  Help me
I've fallen on the inside
I tried to change the game
I tried to infiltrate
But now I'm losing men in cloaks
Always seem to run the show
Save me from the ghosts and shadows
Before they eat my soul
Mercy, mercy
Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me
Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under hypnotised
By another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks
Always have to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows
The world just disavows
Mercy, mercy
Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me
Show me mercy
Show me mercy please
Help me
I've fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks
Trying to devoir my soul
Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
From the gutless and mean
Show me mercy
From the killing machines
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get low
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
Your girl just kissed a girl
I do bi chicks
Shake for a shake
I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spinning this As-salamu alaykum
I love my beaches, south beaches
Surfboard and high tide
I could just roll up
Cause I'm swoll up
So that birthday cake get a cobra
Buggati for real, I'm cold bruh
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
I said rackets, ratchets hold up
(I said rackets, ratchets hold up)
And they already know me
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah my girl you never seen her
Cause my tints by limousines
My touch is the Midas
We de-plus your man to minus
My team blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough that's Bronchitis
Put your hands up
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double up tonkers
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
  Jag känner en bot
och hon kan banna banna dig så hårt
Jag känner en bot
och hon kan banna banna dig så hårt
Jag vill berätta för dig att jag känner en bot,
som alltid vaktar alla som är här,
En bot som ingen ingen annan slår
Och hon kan kicka utan att hon får
Hon gör sig av med alla som spammar
Ja ingen kan slå våran bot
(Musik)
Ready for take off
Are you ready
Då kom den dagen jag inte trodde fanns
Den satte verkligen kanalen ur balans
Jag trodde aldrig att jag hade så fel
Men när Anna skrev och sa
Jag är ingen bot
Jag är en väldigt, väldigt vacker tjej,
Men det finns inget som behöver förklaras,
för i mina ögon är hon alltid en bot
och hon kan banna banna dig så hårt
Jag vill berätta för dig att jag känner en bot,
som alltid vaktar alla som är här,
Kom ihåg att det är jag som känner en bot,
En bot som ingen ingen annan slår,
Ja, ingen kan slå våran bot!
Ready for take off
(musik)
Are you ready
  Boys are cheats and liars
They're such a big disgrace
They will tell you anything
To get to second base-
-ball, baseball
He thinks he's gonna score
If you let him go all the way
Then you are a whore-
-ticulturists study flower
Geologists study rocks
The only thing a guy wants from you
Is a place to put his cock
-roaches, beetles
Butterflies, and bugs
Nothing makes him happier
Than a giant pair of jug-
-glers and acrobat
And dancing bears named Chuck
Forget it, no such luck!
  I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel all right
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of Fame Excess (Whoa), am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy, everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turning and I'm feeling kind of home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away

Moving my hips like Yeah
I got my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, Eh-Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh
Yeah, Eh-Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh
Get to the club in my taxi cab, everybody's looking at me now
Like "Who's that chick that's rocking kicks?"
"She gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos, I guess I never got the memo
My tummy's turning and I'm feeling kind of home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like Yeah
Moving my hips like Yeah
I got my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, Eh-Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh
Yeah, Eh-Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh
Feel like hopping on a flight (On a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (Town tonight)
Something stops me every time (Every time)
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like Yeah (Oh, nodding my head)
Moving my hips like Yeah (Oh Yeah)
I got my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay (Gonna be okay)
Yeah, Eh-Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh

She gives me the runaround,
But I stay chasin'

You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?
Made it lost it came back flipped it
Always faded, lifted
Hit that corner whipped
Hit the dealer, whipped it
Always on it, mind your business
I'm always high, the sky ain't the limit
Ball like Melo, cars all tinted
Chain black and yellow, Pittsburgh Steelers
Sport it knocked it tossed it flipped it
Took my flow and switched it, took my dough invested
Whole life is scripted
All we do is party, drinkin', molly raggin', shawty raggin'
Money come retarted huh, press the button start it up
Tryna be a dope boy ridin' with a coke boy
Strap with the low boy 50 for a show boy
Niggas made it rain I made I it snow boy
Now a nigga hot got millions in the bank
Crib on the water spend a milly on the tank
Montana piece look silly on the link
Montana and Wiz spend millys on the dank
You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?
Smoking weed in my expensive car
I'm ridin' high I'm flyin' high
Told you niggas say the shit you want
So don't even take the chance or try to try my guy
Designer sayin' supplies gettin' low
Weed man say it's kinda dry
Potty mouth, rockstar, at the top and still tryna climb
Drop the top sit back recline
Hundred-K that's just the ride
Fifty-K that's just the change
Thirty-K that's just the time
That's more racks, that's more racks
Private plane you know that's flyin'
I'm bordin' that I'm boadin' that
Rollin' up smoke roy ridin' with the coke boy
Smoking on strong pack hit it when choke boy
When I'm on the road bottles like dope boy
When the police come, I don;t really know boy
Half a pound in seven days that's smokin'
If you ain't bout your family or getting bread you jokin'
You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?
Pick up the pace, turn up the bass
I'm singing this right in your face
I made the call forgive you
Cause I did this all for you
So whether you do or whether you don't
This gon' bang and this gon' bump
Hit your J or split your blunt
DPG then we turned up
Blue bandana, French Montana
All around the world first class
VIP, bubble bath
Touchdown, two points
Wide reciever Khalifa bless me with two joints
They told big Dogg, he gotta get up on this hit dog
Turn it up let me hear the beat for a second
Have a few puffs then I breathe on the record
Then we go like merri-go, round and round
This right here is for the underground
I wonder how, I break it down for you
You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?
  Who is the clown?
Who is the fool?
which one knows that he is blame?
and which one is last in the game?
I can hear the voice, why can they?
I am glad i wasn't born into your world,
I'm not wrong
I like for people to like me
who am i?
I'm all of you
I belong to everyone
Because i belong to no one
In my World, there is no time
Time is being born and dying
Beyond time is living without being afraid
you can't get away from alone
You have to be alone before you can find other people
You can't hold on to life
You can only touch it
How old is forever?
When is too old to hope?
In my World, nothing has always been,
In my World, we can still believe in hope
If you believe in forever, you build a wall around the Now
What is, is always changing
I live in a notion of time
Where the past is lost in the future
There is time for everything
There is time to love
To hope,
You know, what I believe
now I see it so completely,
l, I need you to know,
that time , time is letting go,
Don't cry, dry our eyes,
can't you hears the angels calling, me up, up above ,
Take, take my hand, stay with me, as I surrender,
we've lived a life of happiness,
I, I need you to know, that time is letting go,
  Fill my lungs full of smoke
Fill my belly full of beer
Fill my nights with bad jokes told by folks full of fear
Fill my eyes with a stinging
Fill my time wishing she was here
Fill my wide with the narrow
Fill my safe full of danger
Fill my bed full of shadows
Fill my dreams full of strangers
Fill my ears with a ringing
Fill my heart with a fear of fear
Well fill my cup half empty cause it's never been half full
Fill me up, paint me over, like a damp patch on the wall
Leave me lying on my stomach on your neighbour's bathroom floor
I'm only here till tomorrow anyway
I'm burning up, like a fever that rages in the night
Spark me up, I'm a firework I'll burst into light
For it's better to burn out than to fade out of sight
That's what someone told me anyway
So fill my lungs full of smoke
Fill my belly full of beer
Fill my nose full of cocaine
Fill my eyes full of tears
Fill my short with a longing
Fill my time with wishing I wasn't here
Oh fill my past with regret
Wrap my present in brown paper
Fill my future with promises that promise to come later
Fill my heart with a stinging
Fill my heart with a fear of fear
  Lyrics to A Million Voices
We are the worlds people
Different yet we're the same
We believe
We are the worlds people
Different yet we're the same
We believe
We believe in a dream
Praying for peace and healing
I hope we can start again
We believe
We believe in a dream
So if you ever feel love is fading
Together like the stars in the sky
We can sing
We can shine
When you hear our voices call
You won't be lonely anymore
A million voices
Your heart is like a beating drum
Burning brighter than the sun
A million voices
Now as the world is listening
From cities and satellites
We believe
We believe
In a dream
If you ever feel love is fading
Together like the stars in the sky
We can sing
We can shine
When you hear our voices call
You won't be lonely anymore
A million voices
Your heart is like a beating drum
Burning brighter than the sun
When I look around at these faces
I can see the stars in the sky
We will sing
We will shine
Singing out
Singing out
ooh
Singing out
Singing out
ooh
Singing out
A million voices
All hands on deck
All in front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that
Wasted heart
You took the last bit of love I've ever had
You took a good girl and you turned me oh so bad
Kiss your old bae good bye, she's dead and gone (dead and gone)
Wasted hard
Done this to death, do us apart
I watch you fold like a house of cards
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone
One by one, I watch you fall down, watch you fall like dominoes
Take no prisoners, search and destroy
Baby look at what you've done
One by one, I watch 'em go down, watch 'em fall like dominoes
Watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down
Iggs
Every night another city, different time zone
All I wanna do is get my shine on
Come and deal with Iggy, get your mind blown
New coupe, no roof, got the mind gone
Shittin' on you even when I play polite
I did it all, seen it all twice
Know I gotta get the money, early morning, late nights
Pull up in a S-Class, leave in the Wraith
Murder mommy in designer, know that murder be the case
Tell them hating bitches go and simmer down
I'ma get the paper 'bout as quick as word get around
Posters of me on the wall in your hubby house
What you getting, I been had it and don't want it now
Far as fashion and this rapping, I'm who run it now
Walkthroughs cost a hundred thou, young Iggy owww
And you know that I tried
Really gave my all
Everything we built
Baby you let it fall, you let it fall
And now you want me
Want me back now
And the thing that's so funny
Cause baby I'm long gone, I'm long gone
  The eastern world, it is exploding
Violence flarin', bullets loadin'
You're old enough to kill, but not for votin'
You don't believe in war, but what's that gun you're totin'
And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'
But you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe
We're on the eve
Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say
Can't you feel the fears I'm feelin' today?
If the button is pushed, there's no runnin' away
There'll be no one to save, with the world in a grave
And you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe
We're on the eve
Yeah, my blood's so mad feels like coagulatin'
I'm sitting here just contemplatin'
Handful of senators don't pass legislation
And marches alone can't bring integration
When human respect is disintegratin'
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'
And you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe
We're on the eve
Think of all the hate there is in Red China
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama
You may leave here for 4 days in space
But when you return, it's the same old place
The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace
Hate your next-door neighbor, but don't forget to say grace
And, tell me over and over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve
Of destruction
Mm, no no, you don't believe
We're on the eve
  Come on baby and drop this
Scrub that floor and just mop it
Show these gangsters how you cock block it
Don't care what you got in your pocket
I get the way that you rockin'
Flip that thang thang don't stop it
When I just bang bang and pop it
While the club crowded just watch you (work it out)
Got a gang of cash and it's all thrown out on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast cuz I feel like a superstar (now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (now work it out)
It's your time to grab it,
now make this whole thing yours (now work it out)
Hey, said us hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we make it move
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Some pressure that we can push
Ladies can't get enough
Got my fitness, I'm looking buff
And all my people with me, I trust
Holdin' down for my suit k
If they askin' you, I'm not guilty
All the thing that I'm guilty of is making you rock with me (work it out)
Got a gang of cash and it's all thrown out on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast cuz I feel like a superstar (now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (now work it out)
It's your time to grab it,
now make this whole thing yours (now work it out)
Hey, said us hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we make it move
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do
Work hard, play hard

Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard

Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
  What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning
No kidding
I can't pin you down
Yes!
My heads under water, but I'm breathing fine
You can't -
You can't turn back around!
That's not part of the rules!
That's not -
'Cause all of you
Loves all of me
Love your curves and all your edges
Thank you so much, Pharrell!
Perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
Adam!
Turn around!
Everybody's doing it, baby!
They love me!
America loves me!
Whoo!
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
I give myself to you!
And you!
And you!
And you!
And you, America!
Whoo!
  Look at that booty, show me the booty
Give me the booty, I want the the booty
Back up the booty, I need the booty
I like the booty, oh what a booty
Shaking that booty, I saw the booty
I want the booty, lord what a booty
Bring on the booty, give up the booty
Loving the booty, round booty
Down for the booty, I want the booty
Hunting the booty, chasing the booty
Casing the booty, getting the booty,
Beautiful booty, smoking booty
Fine booty
All about the booty, big old booty
Serious booty, amazing booty

  Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
You tell me your blue skies fade to grey
You tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on
'Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day, you had a bad day
Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on
You had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day, Oh, Holiday
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well Oh that strong and I'm not wrong
Yeah-Eh-Eh-Eh-Yeah
So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I, you kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
'Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, you've seen what you like
And how does it feel, for one more time?
You had a bad day, you had a bad day
(Oh, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah) Had a bad day
(Oh, had a bad day) Had a bad day
(Oh, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah) Had a bad day
(Oh, had a bad day) Had a bad day

För att jag älskar dig, så som du är
Låt mig få bära dig när du är svag,
För att jag älskar dig, så som du är
och jag vill ge dig allting jag har
och låt mig få bära dig när du är svag,
Ja, jag ska älska dig så som du är
Var inte rädd, jag står bredvid dig
  I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it
People talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm done with it, oh
This is the start of how it all ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time
And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I'm done with it, oh
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat
  I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love
I take a deep breath everytime I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
I feel so out of see
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love
Now I'm dreaming, will I ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love
All the years
All the times
You were never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears
All the lies
All the waste
I've been trying to make it change
And now my eyes are open
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free

  Can you feel it?
Now it's coming back
We can steal it
If we bridge this gap
I can see you
Through the curtains of the waterfall
When I lost it
Yeah you held my hand
But I tossed it
Didn't understand
You were waiting
As I dove into the waterfall
So say Geronimo

We can make this leap
Through the curtains of the waterfall

All lost and coy
At the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand
As a broken man
But I found my friend
At the curtains of the waterfall
Now I'm falling down, through the crashing sound
And you've come around
At the curtains of the waterfall

  You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make up
To cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell
You don't know oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh
that's what makes you beautiful
So c-come on
You got it wrong
To prove I'm right I put it in a song
I don't no why
You're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell
You don't know oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know oh, oh

You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh
that's what makes you beautiful
  At least one moment everyday
I hear the echo of your voice
And though it's only in my mind
It stays with me, I have no choice
I reach for you as if you're here
Your tender touch, your warm embrace
And though it's been so many years
I still can see your face
We're all just prisoners of time
(The days go rushing by)
With memories we've locked away
There may not be much I regret
But there were things we couldn't say
Maybe the ending came too soon
You are the one I can't replace
And though it's been so many years
I still can see your face
Somehow we knew another love would find us
We'd carry on, leave yesterday behind us
Sometimes I find in quiet nights
I close my eyes and realize
I've never let you go
And if by chance we meet again
(We meet again)
A sudden crazy twist of fate
A street where we have never been
And with the hour getting late
You run into my open arms
Like all the years have been erased
In every shadow of the past
I still can see your face
In every shadow of the past
I still can still your face
  Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
Where are the clowns?
Just when I'd stopped
Opening doors,
Finally knowing
The one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again
With my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
Don't you love farce?
I thought that you'd want what I want -
But where are the clowns?
Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
In my career?
And where are the clowns?
  Nobody sees - Nobody knows
We are a secret - can't be exposed
That's how it is - That's how it goes
Far from the others
Close to each other
In the daylight - in the daylight
When the sun is shining
On a late night, on a late night
When the moon is blinding
In plain sight - Plain sight
Like stars in hiding
You and I burn on, on
Put 2 and 2 gether - 4ever
We'll never change
2 and 2 gether
We'll never change
Nobody sees - Nobody knows
We are a secret - can't be exposed
That's how it is - That's how it goes
Far from the others
Close to each other
That's when we uncover, cover, cover
That's when we uncover, cover, cover
My asylum - My asylum
Is in your arms
When the world gives heavy burdens
I can bare a thousand tons
On your shoulder - on your shoulder
I can reach an endless sky
Feels like paradise
Put 2 and 2 gether - 4ever
We'll never change
2 and 2 gether
We'll never change
Nobody sees - Nobody knows
We are a secret - can't be exposed
That's how it is - That's how it goes
Far from the others
Close to each other
That's when we uncover, cover, cover
That's when we uncover, cover, cover
All the world could disappear
Wouldn't notice, wouldn't care
The world could disappear
Yeah I just need you near
Nobody sees - Nobody knows
We are a secret - can't be exposed
That's how it is - That's how it goes
Far from the others
Close to each other
That's when we uncover, cover, cover
That's when we uncover, cover, cover

But I found heaven as love swept low
My heart beating, my soul breathing
I found my life when I laid it down
Upward falling, spirit soaring
I touch the sky when my knees hit the ground
What treasure waits within Your scars
This gift of freedom gold can't buy
I bought the world and sold my heart
You traded heaven to have me again
My heart beating, my soul breathing

Upward falling, spirit soaring
I touch the sky when my knees hit the ground
Find me here at Your feet again
Everything I am, reaching out, I surrender
Come sweep me up in Your love again

Come sweep me up in Your love again
And my soul will dance
On the wings of forever
Upward falling, spirit soaring
I touch the sky
When my knees hit the ground
  The day we met
frozen, I held my breath
right from the start
knew that I found a home
for my heart,
Beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid
To fall
Watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died everyday
waiting for you
Darlin' don't be afraid
I have loved you for a
Thousand years,
Love you for a
Thousand more
Time stands still
beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything
Take away
Standing in front of me
Every breath,
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died everyday
Waiting for you
Darlin' don't be afraid
I have loved you for a
Thousand years,
Love you for a
Thousand more
All along I believed
I would find you
Time has brought
Your heart to me
I have loved you for a
Thousand years,
Love you for a
Thousand more,
Love you for a
Thousand more
One step closer
I have died everyday
Waiting for you
Darlin' don't be afraid,
I have loved you for a
Thousand years,
Love you for a
Thousand more
All along I believed
I would find you
Time has brought
Your heart to me
I have loved you for a
Thousand years,
Love you for a
Thousand more

  Put your makeup on
Get your nails done, curl your hair
Run the extra mile, keep it slim
So they like you, do they like you?
Get your sexy on
Don't be shy, Girl, take it off
This is what you want, to belong
So they like you, do you like you?
You don't have to try so hard
You don't have to, give it all away
You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up
You don't have to change a single thing
You don't have to try-try-try, try-y-y
You don't have to try-try-try, try-y-y
You don't have to try-try-try, try-y-y
You don't have to try, yo-o-ou don't have to try
MMM-MMM-MMM
Get your shopping on
At the mall, max your credit cards
You don't have to choose, buy it all
So they like you, do they like you?
Wait a second
Why should you care what they think of you?
When you're all alone, by yourself
Do you like you? Do you like you?
You don't have to try so hard
You don't have to, give it all away
You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up
You don't have to change a single thing
You don't have to try so hard
You don't have to, bend until you break
You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up
You don't have to change a single thing
You don't have to try-try-try, try-y-y
You don't have to try-try-try, try-y-y
You don't have to try-try-try, try-y-y
You don't have to try
Well you don't have to try-try-try, try-y-y
You don't have to try-try-try, try-y-y
You don't have to try-try-try, try-y-y
You don't have to try, yo-o-ou don't have to try
No-Oh-Oh-Oh
MMM-MMM-MMM
You don't have to try so hard
You don't have to, give it all away
You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up
You don't have to change a single thing
You don't have to try-try-try, try-y-y
You don't have to try-try-try, try-y-y
You don't have to try, you don't have to try
Take your makeup off
Let your hair down, take a breath
Look into the mirror, at yourself
Don't you like you? 'Cause I like you
  Witchcraft, voodoo
Love experiments, and face burning
Potions, lotion, perfume to find you
The man come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
The man come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
Oh, my heart ached, but I know fate
Would send you my way
And when you came my heart was saved
I've known you for lifetimes, baby
I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a déjà vu
(Déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
Now I've got nothing to lose
(Déjà vu, déjà vu
Déjà vu, déjà vu)
Moments in time
I'm yours and you're mine
Two souls, one heart
Two souls, one heart
The man come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
The man come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a déjà vu
(Déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
Now I've got nothing to lose
(Déjà vu, déjà vu)
In love you'll always find
Two of a kind, baby
And in your lovin' arms
Here we are, livin' the dream
In love you'll always find
Two of a kind, baby
And in your lovin' arms
Here we are, livin' the dream
I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a déjà vu
(Déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
Feeling the love and I'll set it loose
(Déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
Now I've got nothing to lose
Déjà vu
  Adventure Time
Come on grab your friends
well go to very distant lands
with Jake the dog
and Finn the human
The fun will never end
its adventure time!
  When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
In the dark I found, I stop and I won't fly
And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light, you're my flash light
I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
I'm not the afraid when the rain won't stop
Cause you light the way
You light the way, you light the way
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light, you're my flash light
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light, you're my flash light
  Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me, and I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped "who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much,
you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin', fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face,
spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways,
guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Eminem:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship, isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize,
even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of
The games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again,
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
  Dance, yes (RedOne)

Mr Worldwide, and the world's most beautiful woman
Modern day Hugh Hef (uh, yes)
Playboy to the death (uh, yes)
Is he really worldwide? (uh, yes)
Mami let me open your treasure chest
Play dates, we play mates
I'm the king at snatching queens, checkmate
What you think?
It's a rumor
I'm really out of this world
Moon, luna
Make woman comfortable
Call me bloomer
Can't even show love cause they'll sue ya
But I told them, 'hallelujah, have a blessed day'
So ahead of myself
Everyday's yesterday
Want the recipe? it's real simple
Little bit of voli, and she'll open sesame
Now dance yes
Love next
Dance yes
Love next
If this would be a perfect world
We'd be together then
(let's do it do it do it)
Only got just one life this i've learned
Who cares what they're gonna say

I wanna dance, and love, and dance again

Wallets, wallets, wallets, wallets, wallets
Y'all sleepin' in the streets
Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver 40, Niko shit man, 15 Fort York shit ya know
I wonder whats poppin'
Yeah, yeah
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that ferrari then I swerve
I want that bugatti just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry thats on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that
My city to turnt up I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
Thats been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbraud jeans
I had a yellow techno marine
Then Kanye dropped it was polos and backpacks
Thats when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Don't fuck with them niggas they too irrational
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up in here got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Wendy
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga who thinks about money and women
Like twenty four seven, thats where my life took me
Thats just how shit happened to go
No bomboclat, I die
Thats the truth, OVO unruly
With my woes
Yeah
Usher, baby
This is for the A
Shawty, I don't mind If you dance on a pole
That don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind when you work until three
If you're leaving with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes
Long as you coming home, girl, I don't mind
The ballers in here tonight, they gon' buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon' make it colossal in here
Cause shawty you thinkin' them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you
Like they seen Beyonce in here
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A
When you get off of work I'll be ready to go in the 'Rari
And when we get home we'll have us our own private party in here
So I don't worry at all about the things they do or say
I love you anyway
You can twerk it while in a split, you racking up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin', I'm proud to call you my bitch
They be lookin', but they can't touch you, shawty
I'm the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doing what you do, do it
(is ya boy, Juicy J)
I'm just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that's third base
It's okay if you work late, we can still party like it's your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place, blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways
  I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again
(Aye aye nigga whats happenin' nigga, K Dot back in the hood nigga)
I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer
What the fuck happened?
(Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell
(A two man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum
Than a motherfuckin' baller
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(You goat mouth mammy fucker)
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton"
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo
Ah yeah fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'-
(By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you)
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, King Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
  As I come into Your presence
Past the gates of praise
Into Your sanctuary
Til we're standing face to face
I look upon Your countenance
I see the glory of Your Holy face
You are awesome in this place, Mighty God
You are awesome in this place, Abba Father
You are worthy of all praise
To You our hands we raise
You are awesome in this place, Mighty God
  Yeah, yeah, yeah
Her beauty's crazy
I watch her from the crowd
Her voice is so amazing
She make her momma proud
I tried to send her flowers
But she has no address
Her home is in my heart
It's like she never left
This is more than a crush
More than a like like
More than a love
Baby I'mma make you mine
And I ain't givin' up
This is more than a crush
More than a like like
More than a love
Baby I'mma make you mine
And I ain't givin' up
Don't run away
Don't run away from the Truth
'Cause I'm not givin' up on you
Don't run away
Don't run away from the Truth
'Cause I'm not givin' up on you
Shorty you got fire
But I'm preaching to the choir
I know you know
The whole world is watching you, so
Don't run away
Don't run away from the truth
'Cause I'm not givin' up on you
Uh, they say true love is blind
That real romance is timeless
You're like my favorite movie
Play it then rewind it
'Cause baby you're the finest
Your love I'm gonna find it
And when I do, I'll run away with you
Somewhere where they can't find us
This is more than a crush
More than a like like
More than a love
Baby I'mma make you mine
And I ain't givin' up
This is more than a crush
More than a like like
More than a love
Baby I'mma make you mine
And I ain't givin' up
Don't run away
Don't run away from the Truth
'Cause I'm not givin' up on you
Don't run away
Don't run away from the Truth
'Cause I'm not givin' up on you
Shorty you got fire
But I'm preaching to the choir
I know you know
The whole world is watching you, so
Don't run away
Don't run away from the Truth
'Cause I'm not giving up on you
Normally I couldn't turn your head
That's why I had to write this instead
Let's be friends, start out slow
Get to know you beyond your glow
You're more than meets the eye
Girl you're pterodactyl fly
Way back when you knew my name
The truth is what I bring
Don't run away
Don't run away from the Truth
'Cause I'm not giving up on you
Don't run away
Don't run away from the Truth
'Cause I ain't giving up on you
Shorty you got fire
But I'm preaching to the choir
I know you know
The whole world is watching you, so
Don't run away
Don't run away from the Truth
'Cause I'm not giving up on you
Skulle gett dig mer än tusen ord
gett dig hela bilden så du förstod
att jag föll på nytt varje gång du log
och dog inuti varje morgon du drog
Du hade alltid så bråttom
snacka om plugg i Paris och i London
jag hade saker på G här i Stockholm
och rätt vad det var så flög du till Hong Kong
Har aldrig fått det funka med distans
man ser varann på nån bild, Instagram
jag jaga likes medan du levde life
sakna varandra ändå typ konstant
Tills du träffa nån annan
såg er på Söder i hand med varandra
mötte din blick och jag vet att du smajla
för vår energi kommer alltid va starkast
Kvart i fem nu och alla andra har gått hem
vi står kvar fast vi borde gått för längesen
när ingen ser kan vi låtsas att vi känner som
vår första gång, en sista gång
Sommaren, mitt i natten bara jag och du
och det känns som att tiden aldrig kan ta slut
när ingen ser kan vi låtsas att vi känner som
vår första gång, en sista gång
Jag vet jag borde hålla mig nu
du vet du borde hålla dig nu
ändå ligger jag här och håller om dig
tills natten blir morgon, inte okej
Jag fråga om honom, du svara försiktigt
att det vi två hade det kändes på riktigt
och det du har nu är mer tidsfördriv
för att fylla den lucka jag saknas i
Det kunde ju varit så okomplicerat
glöm och förlåt allting, hur det blev senast
vi skrattar, vi hånglar, vi ligger och skedar
men vår tid är lånad snart är den försenad
Kvart i fem nu och alla andra har gått hem
vi står kvar fast vi borde gått för längesen
när ingen ser kan vi låtsas att vi känner som
vår första gång, en sista gång
Sommaren, mitt i natten bara jag och du
och det känns som att tiden aldrig kan ta slut
när ingen ser kan vi låtsas att vi känner som
vår första gång, en sista gång
vår första gång, en sista gång
Kvart i fem nu och alla andra har gått hem
vi står kvar fast vi borde gått för längesen
ingen ser och vi låtsas att vi känner som
vår första gång
en sista gång
Kvart i fem nu och alla andra har gått hem
vi står kvar fast vi borde gått för längesen
när ingen ser kan vi låtsas att vi känner som
vår första gång, en sista gång
Sommaren, mitt i natten bara jag och du
och det känns som att tiden aldrig kan ta slut
när ingen ser kan vi låtsas att vi känner som
vår första gång, en sista gång
vår första gång, en sista gång
vår första gång, en sista gång
  I eat my dinner in my bathtub
Then I go to sexclubs
Watching freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub
Then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money
Tasted kinda lonely
You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe
I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Pick up daddies at the playground
How I spend my daytime
Loosen up the frown,
Make them feel alive
I'll make it fast and greasy
I know I'm way too easy
You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe
I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Ooh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Ooh
You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe
I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
  As a kid, they told me love was made up
But I used to tell them they were wrong
Because the blue eyed girl that made me wake up
Was there right behind me in this song
Instead they counted every heartbeat
Thinking about the words to say
Try not to understand that feeling
And would it ever go away
Now those were the days
Before you had to go away
Now I'm dancing by myself
Out in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold
And I just wanted you to know
That if my dreams will ever be
Will you come dancing next to me
Next to me
You told me we would be forever
But maybe we were just too young
I wonder if you still remember
When we were dancing in the sun
Now those were the days
Before you had to go away
Now I'm dancing by myself
Out in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold
And I just wanted you to know
That if my dreams will ever be
Will you come dancing next to me
Next to me
Do you hear me,
I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my, baby I'm trying
Boy I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you I promise you, I will
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday
And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
Though the breezes through trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
I'm lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday
Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
  I was listening to the ocean
I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands,daaa
I had a dream I was 7
Climbing my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waiting impatient for me, daaa
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you and
For a moment I thought you were here
But again, it wasn't true, daaa
And all this time I have been lying
Oh, lying in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the farest place
On my shelf, da di da
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
But I kept running
For a soft place to fall
And I kept running
For a soft place to fall
And I kept running
For a soft place to fall
And I kept running
For a soft place to fall
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
But now take me home
home where I belong
Now, take me home
home where I belong
Now, take me home
Home where I belong
Now, take me home
Home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone, the public excuse me
For wanting my cake, And eat it to, and wanting it both ways
Fame may be a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew seep it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Hit the lottery, oh wee
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going cucko and cucky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's not fair
Well, that's not fair
Now I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
Cause you never know when it could all be over
tomorrow so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it
Do you wonder there's no wonder you're losing
your mind the way you're brought up?)
I think you've been wandering off down yonder
and stumbled upon Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I needed an intervention in this to intervene
between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and
I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice of my head saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's not fair
Well, that's not fair
Call me crazy, but I had this vision
One day that I'd walk amongst you, a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
Pumped up feelin' and shit to say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fvcking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
Straw into gold chump I will spin
Rumplestiltskin in a hay stack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's not fair
  Ännu spelar syrsor
till vindarnas sus
Ännu rullar kulorna
på skolgårdens grus
Och än strålar solen
på brunbrända ben
Ännu ruvar fåglarna
fast timmen är sen
Det finns tid till försoning
innan dagen är förbi
För jag tror, jag tror på friheten
jag lever i
Och är det inte verklighet
så drömmer jag
Sol, vind och vatten är
det bästa som jag vet
men det är på dig jag
tänker i hemlighet
Sol, vind och vatten
höga berg och djupa hav
Det, är mina drömmar vävda av
Jag vill veta vägen
till herdarnas hus
Jag behöver att omges
av en ledstjärnas ljus
Det skymmer vid sion
och natten blir sval
Men än doftar blommorna
i skuggornas dal
Det finns tid till försoning
innan natten slagit ut
För jag tror, jag tror att livet
får ett lyckligt slut
Och är det inte verklighet
så drömmer jag
Sol, vind och vatten är
det bästa som jag vet
men det är på dig jag
tänker i hemlighet
Sol, vind och vatten
höga berg och djupa hav
Det är mina drömmar vävda av
Sol, vind och vatten
höga berg och djupa hav
Det är mina drömmar vävda av
Mm, Ja, det är mina drömmar vävda av
  Silent, I can't wait here silent
Working up a storm inside my head
Nothing, I just stood for nothing
So I fell for everything you said
Hear the rumble
Hear my voice
Silent, I can't wait here silent
Gotta make a change and make some noise
Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last I know what I should do
Undo my sad
Trouble, baby I'm in trouble
Everytime I look into your eyes
Save me, oh I'm gonna save me
Far away from all the crazy lies
Hear the rumble
Hear my voice
Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last I know what I should do
Undo my sad
My sad love
Undo
  Min bleka kind är svart av smink
Hör hela huset sova tungt
Finns inget jag behöver som är någon annanstans
Jag skulle kunna dö nu, med kinden mot din hals
Jag reser mig ur våran säng, lämnar dig sovande min vän
Jag smyger över golvet, ser solen stiga upp
I samma stund så vet jag att allting har ett slut
Allt är för bra nu
Går runt i t-shirt och är trött
Sitter på pianot mellan flaskor, glas och fimpar
Blundar tills jag skymtar lyckan och jag vet att allt är för bra nu
Allt är bra nu
Festen har dött för längesen
Soffan har blivit till en säng
Jag lånar någons stövlar i storlek 45
Går ut igenom dörren och där är sommaren
I gräset sover någon än, ser ganska obekvämt ut men
Jag knäpper några bilder och skrattar för mig själv
I samma stund så vet jag att allting har ett slut
Allt är för bra nu
Går runt i t-shirt och är trött
Sitter på pianot mellan flaskor, glas och fimpar
Blundar tills jag skymtar lyckan och jag vet att allt är för bra nu
Allt är bra nu
Allt är för bra nu
Går runt i t-shirt och är trött
Sitter på pianot mellan flaskor, glas och fimpar
Blundar tills jag skymtar lyckan
Allt är för bra nu
Går runt i t-shirt och är trött
Sitter på pianot mellan flaskor, glas och fimpar
Blundar tills jag skymtar lyckan och jag vet
Allt är för bra nu
Allt är bra nu
  Cause you're a sky, Cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm going to give you my heart
Cause you're a sky, Cause you're a sky full of stars
Cause you light up the path
I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky, Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you
Cause you're a sky, Cause you're a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms
Cause you get lighter
The more it gets dark
I'm going to give you my heart
And I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky, Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you
Because you're a sky
You're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
Such a heavenly view

  Det var dans och hålligång uppå logen natten lång
Det var sommar, det var guld och gröna skogar
Det är en stilla kväll men jag får ingen ro
Solen dröjer kvar vid havets rand
Jag börjar tänka på en gång för länge sen
En annan kväll i pilevallars land
Spelemännen spelade som elden vore lös
Pågarna från Sjöbo var vilda och de svingade varsin tös
Det var dans och hålligång uppå logen natten lång
Det var sommar, det var guld och gröna skogar
Jag var ung och du var grann, som vi älskade varann
Det var sommar, det var guld och gröna skogar
Under eken där vid ån frågade du mig
Om jag var din i alla våra dar
Och solen sänkte sig när fiolen stämde upp
Jag lovade att alltid stanna kvar
Det var dans och hålligång uppå logen natten lång
Det var sommar, det var guld och gröna skogar
Jag var ung och du var grann, som vi älskade varann
Och jag lovade dig guld och gröna skogar
Spelemännen spelade som elden vore lös
Pågarna från Sjöbo var vilda och de svingade varsin tös
Det var dans och hålligång uppå logen natten lång
Det var sommar, det var guld och gröna skogar
Jag var ung och du var grann, som vi älskade varann
Och jag lovade dig guld och gröna skogar
Lalala lala lala
Lalala lala lala
Jag var ung och du var grann, som vi älskade varann
Det var sommar det var guld och gröna skogar
Så ge mig sommar, ge mig guld och gröna skogar
  Sommartider, hej hej, sommartider
(Sommartider)
Jag känner det är nånting på gång
(Sommartider)
(Sommartider)
Kom och stanna ute natten lång
(Sommartider)
Snurra runt i en stad som glöder,
som viskar: Bli min i natt
Sommartider, hej hej, sommartider
Ge mig din hunger, ge mig din hand
Ge mig allt du vill och allt du kan
Sommartider, hej hej, sommartider
Läppar mot läppar, som tar mig i land
som ger sommartider till varann
(Sommartider)
Sommar Sommar våt och het
(Sommartider)
(Sommartider)
Kom och lek en sommarlek
(Sommartider)
Lev ditt liv i den tid som brinner,
Sommartider, hej hej, sommartider
Ge mig din hunger, ge mig din hand
Ge mig allt du vill och allt du kan
Sommartider, hej hej, sommartider!
Läppar mot läppar, två hjärtan i brand
som ger sommartider till varann
(Sommartider)
(Sommartider)
(Sommartider)
Sommartider, hej hej, sommartider!
Ge mig din hunger, ge mig din hand
Ge mig allt du vill och allt du kan
Sommartider, hej hej, sommartider!
Läppar mot läppar som tar mig i land
som ger sommartider till varann
Sommartider, hej hej, sommartider!
Ge mig din hunger, ge mig din hand
Ge mig allt du vill och allt du kan
Sommartider, hej hej, sommartider!
Läppar mot läppar, två hjärtan i brand
som ger sommartider till varann

Catching villains is a no

Curve's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the fatness
You never quiet know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump night trump tight, everyday
You're blowing my mind, baby in time
Maybe I can get you with my ride
I like the way you work it

فوجدتُ أنّي خاسر، فتلك مظاهر

لا لا
لا نحتاج المال، كي نزداد جمالا، جوهرنا هنا، في القلب تلالا

  Jag kan inte prata med dig när du tittar bort
snälla ge mig två sekunder innan du ger upp
kan vi inte vara nära bara en minut
är det nu, nu som det tar slut?
Fast du inte lyssnar vet jag att du hör ändå
jag vill hinna säga allting innan jag ska gå
älskling, vänta får jag bara sitta bredvid dig
det var han som ville kyssa mig
Snälla bli min igen
nej, låt det va' som i en film
snälla bli min igen
låt mig va' kvar
ja, låt det va'
Du tar bort min hand ifrån din arm
och flyttar bort
ingenting jag säger spelar längre någon roll
ställer mig i hallen tills jag fattar vad som hänt
får jag ens ha kvar dig som min vän?
knyter mina skor och går tillbaka in igen
sitter här på sängen tills du be mig att gå hem
letar efter nå't att säga som kan ändra allt
nå't mer än det jag redan sagt
Snälla bli min igen
nej, låt det va' som i en film
snälla bli min igen
låt mig va' kvar
ja, låt det va'
  There's a place I go where there's no heat
But it never gets cold, and that I know for sure
There's a rusted gate and a chandelier,
a flowered door and a mattress on the floor
She lays me down so low here under the stars
And knowing it won't last just tears me apart
This is how it goes
This is how it goes
Baby, we're rolling
Just a boat on the ocean
Up in the sky
Heaven so close
Taking off your clothes
Taking off my clothes
Give me a moment
I don't care if it's stolen
Way up high
in your sweet little bungalow
She's got a temper, yeah and like a redhead,
a tabby cat and a tattoo she regrets
She's a carpenter with a book of poems
Got another side that no one really knows
Watching through the window you smile in the dark
Knowing we can't stay here, but you left a mark
This is how it goes
This is how it goes
Baby, we're rolling
Just a boat on the ocean
Up in the sky
Heaven so close
Taking off your clothes
Taking off my clothes
Give me a moment
I don't care if it's stolen
Way up high
in your sweet little bungalow
This is enough, don't be insecure
As long as you kiss me when I walk through your window to your door
And I'll know when the night is filled with cold
We'll be warm, and nothing matters when the world is moving slow
I got you in my arms
Now it's fine, don't feel low
This is how it goes
This is how it goes
Baby, we're rolling
Just a boat on the ocean
Up in the sky
Heaven so close
Taking off your clothes
Taking off my clothes
Give me a moment
I don't care if it's stolen
Way up high
in your sweet little bungalow
  I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
So I'm supposed to believe that it's Fellini's calling your phone?
I'm s'posed to believe that they're asking you if you're home
I wasn't born yesterday, not me
Can't get that over me, not me
I love you, but I won't be a fool for you
That is just something that I wouldn't do, babe
I mean I'mma stay if you could tell the truth
But you can't, no matter how much time I ask
Is that your bitch over there, giving' me the ugly stare
The one with the silicone ass, and the Brazilian hair
You ain't gon' respect me no no no till I'm not there
See, I got you comfortable, now you ain't really scared
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
So you bought me a car, he can buy that too
I can take care of myself and I can find someone to do it too, baby
You actin' like you upgraded me, I upgraded you
You and me Fashion Week at Paris, I put you on to that new
But you took advantage, oh you took advantage, oh you took advantage
I cannot understand, I cannot understand, I cannot understand it
I thought you'd always be there for me, yeah yeah
But if you ask me if I knew betta now, hell yeah
So you can keep that bitch over there, giving me the ugly stare
The one with the silicone ass, and the Brazilian hair
You ain't gon' respect me no no no till I ain't there
See, I got you comfortable, now you ain't really scared
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
Baby, tell me what's it
Gonna take to keep it
All the way one hundred
You won't get it till I'm gone away (Away)
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I hate, I hate that I'm
Singing this song
Singing this song
'Cause I love you
Yeah I love you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm all cried out
I'm all tried out
I'm all fired out
Yeah
Right now, it's killing me
Cause now I have to find someone else
When all I wanted was you
(STUPID) Love, soft as an easy chair
(STUPID) Love, fresh as the morning air
(STUPID) Love, that is shared by two
(STUPID) Love, I found in you
  If I had to live my life without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long
With you I see forever oh so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong
Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now, touch me now
I don't want to live without you
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through
But nothing's gonna change my love for you
If the road ahead is not so easy
Our love will lead the way for us
Like a guiding star
I'll be there for you if you should need me
You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are
So come with me and share the view
I'll help you see forever too
Hold me now, touch me now
I don't want to live without you
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

  Little girls, little girls
Everywhere i turn i can see them
Little girls, little girls
Night and day I eat, sleep, and breathe them
I should be anywhere but here
on a plane, or the stage, or on TV,
Please kill me!
I'm not singing, I'm asking!
Locked in a cage with all the rats,
I slipped through the cracks and now I'm
I'm done with little girls!
I want to be someone in this world!
Little girls, little girls
GET OUTTA HERE!
Locked in a cage with all the rats,
I slipped through the cracks and now I'm
I want to be someone in this world!
  Blood looks like paste on the wall
Bodies lay lifeless like dolls
A moment that felt like days
Lives extinct with inner rage
Incessantly making up lies
In a moment of visceral hate
Eyes
The last thing you'll see are my eyes
Panic, you scream for your god
Blood falls from the ceiling like rain
Darkness this feeling I love
To be covered in blood
Blood from above
This violence finally sets me free
Brings demons back to torture me
There's no god pulling at my strings
I'm above all sorrow that fate can bring
Disengaged, I see your face
I turn and rush, I can't replace
Staring into your eyes
When the stillness comes
  Someone's knocking at the door
Someone's knocking at the door
Can you hear Him knocking
Can you hear Him knocking
He's been knocking very long
He's been knocking for so long
Can you hear Him knocking
Can you hear Him knocking
Someone's calling out your name
Calling time and time again
Can you hear Him calling
Can you hear Him calling
He's been calling very long
He's been calling for so long
Can you hear Him calling
He's been calling you
Don't let him walk away
He's so patient but, don't take a chance
All you need to do is open the door
Let Him take his rightful place
So He can change your world
  I hate the way you talk to me
And the way you cut your hair
I hate the way you drive my car
I hate it when you stare
I hate your big dumb combat boots
And the way you read my mind
I hate you so much that it makes me sick
It even makes me ryhme
I hate the way you're always right
I hate it when you lie
I hate it when you make me laugh
Even worse when you make me cry
I hate the way you're not around
And the fact that you didn't call
But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you
Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all
  I don't like the way he's looking at you
I'm starting to think you want him too
Am I crazy, have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can't help it
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
I wish you didn't have to post it all
I wish you'd save a little bit just for me
Protective or possessive, yeah
Call it passive or aggressive
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
You're the only one invited
I said there's no one else for you
'Cause you know I get excited, yeah
When you get jealous too
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm turning red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
Oh (that's why)
I still get jealous
Oh (that's why)
I still get jealous
  Run to the water and see
No one knows, except for me
And I know time has come
So run to the water, baby, run
Take my hand, I'll give you strength
Guide you home through forgotten lands
See the world that's at your feet
If you close your eyes, you'll never see the deep
Run to the water, baby
Run to the water
Run to the water, baby
Run
Whatever it is, you know that I'll find you
Wherever you go, you know that I got you
Nothing can take you, lead you away from home
Whenever you need me, I'll be beside you
Carry you with me, I'll light the way back home
The way back home
Run to the water and see
Trust yourself and you'll be free
  Jag är sexton år
Jag är platsen dom aldrig upptäckte
Jag är en storm från ingenstans
Jag kan krossa ditt hjärta
Som en orkan kan jag svepa bort dig
Men jag tänker aldrig dö, nej
Det kommer aldrig va över för mig
Jag kommer älska dig när jorden gått under
För jag tänker aldrig dö, nej
Det kommer aldrig va över för mig
Jag är tjugofyra
Bara en liten gnista
Bara ett ord kan sätta eld på en skog
Jag kan älska dig just som den där elden
Men jag tänker aldrig dö, nej
Det kommer aldrig va över för mig
Jag kan bränna dig som du aldrig bränt dig
Om du leker med mig
Det kommer aldrig va över för mig
Jag är trettionio
Jag är ett tappat självförtroende
En pojke från förr är tillbaks igen
Han bara står där
Och stirrar mig rakt ner i själen
Vi skulle älska varandra tills jorden gick under
Det skulle aldrig va över för dig
Jag kommer älska dig när jorden gått under
För jag tänker aldrig dö, nej
Det kommer aldrig va över för mig
  Hejsan morsan, hejsan stabben!
Här är brev från älsklingsgrabben
Vi har kul på kolonien
Vi bor 28 gangstergrabbar i en
Stor barack med massa sängar
Kan ni skicka mera pengar?
För det vore en god gärning
Jag har spelat bort vartenda dugg på tärning
Här är roligt vill jag lova
Fastän lite svårt att sova
Killen som har sängen över mig
Han vaknar inte han när han behöver nej
Jag har tappat två framtänder
För jag skulle gå på händer
När vi lattjade charader
Så när morsan nu får se mig får hon spader
Ute i skogen finns baciller
Men min kompis han har piller
Som han köpt utav en ful typ
Och om man äter dom blir man en jättekul typ
Jag är inte rädd för spöken
Och min kompis han har kröken
Som han gjort utav potatis
Och den säljer han i baracken nästan gratis
Våran fröken är försvunnen
Hon har dränkt sig uti brunnen
För en morgon blev hon galen
För vi släppte ut en huggorm i matsalen
Föreståndaren han har farit
Han blir aldrig var han varit
För polisen kom och tog hand
Om honom förra veckan när vi lekte skogsbrand
Ute i skogen finns det rådjur
I baracken finns det smådjur
Och min bäste kompis Tage
Han har en liten fickkniv inuti sin mage
Honom ska dom operera
Ja, nu vet jag inge mera
Kram och kyss och hjärtligt tack sen
Men nu ska vi ut och bränna grannbaracken!
Shady
Convict
Upfront
Akon
Slim Shady
I see the one, because she be that lady
Hey
I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Taboe
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!
Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club now and wardobe intact now!
I feel it down and cracked now (ooh)
I see it dull and backed now
I'm gonna call her, than I pull the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!
I feel you creeping, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboe
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Oh, Looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a lil' drink on
They goin' flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it!
Pedicure manicure kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them Pussycat dolls
Trying to hold my woody back throuh my drawers
Steps upstage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, shes like "your"
I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace shall I say
And plus I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact he is the one singing the song that's playing
"Akon!"
I feel you creepin, I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboe
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Eminem is rollin', d and em rollin' bo
And all marvelous them rolling
Women just holding big booty rollin'
Soon I'll be on Eminem throwin "D!"
Hittin on less than "Three!"
Block wheel style like "Whee!"
Girl I can tell you want me because lately
I feel you creepin, I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboe
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain't nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge, I won't back down
Cause it's time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family
Five, four, three, two, I got one shot
You lose the love and respect, that's where the trust stop
New work, top drop
I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop
And you can smell just how I'm smokin' when I burn out
And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not
It's love and loyalty until my heart lock
Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out
I said it once, I'll do it again
I'm playin' the game, I do it to win
With you and your friend, that's thick and thin
That's me and my team, you know we gon' win
You know we gon' ball, you know we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
You know we gon' stick to the course, we ain't thinkin' 'bout y'all
M-O-N-E-Y, what I go hard for
Swingin' on the green like I'm tryna get a par four
You ain't sittin' at my table, hope you starve
Ho, don't be pushin' my buttons 'less you startin' up my car
Pressure make a diamond, that pressure make me a star
Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar
People always askin' me how I got this far
My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are
Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers
Glory, hallelujah, I'mma take that ass to church
I'mma finish like I started, Iggy still got that work
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man they say murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the Hanging Tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where the dead man called out for his love to flee
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the Hanging Tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where I told you to run so we'd both be free
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the Hanging Tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of hope, side by side with me
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the Hanging Tree
  Och nu så vill jag sjunga
att sommaren är skön,
och träden är så fina
och marken är så grön,
och blommorna är vackra
och höet luktar gott
och solen är så solig
och vattnet är så vått,
och lille fågeln flyger
i boet ut och inn,
och därför vill jag sjunga
Och jag vill också sjunga
att fjärilar är bra,
och alle söta myggor,
dom vill jag också ha,
och jag är brun om bena
precis som det ska va,
och därför vill jag sjunga
Och jeg har nya fräknar
och prickigt sommarskinn,
och därför vill jag sjunga
Yea
Let's take'em back
Uh huh
Coming up I was confused
My mama kissing a girl
Confusion occurs
Coming up in a cold world
Daddy aint around
Probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing
Check, check out my melody
For a four-finger rings
One of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I get a sheep skin coat
If I could move a few packs
I get the hat
Tossed and turn in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning
Niggaz done stole my bike
Ain't nothing good in the hood
And never come back if I could
Hate it or love it the under dog's on top
And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop
Go'head'n envy me
I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't going no where
So you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the under dog's on top
And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop
Go'head'n envy me
I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't going no where
So you can get to know me
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit
On the grill of ma low rider
Guns on both sides
Right above the gold wires I four-five'em
Kill a nigga on ma song
And really do it
That's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten g'z will take your daughter outta air forces
Believe you me homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call, have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been banging since ma lil' nigga, rob, got killed for his Barkley's
That's ten years
I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my air-max 95's
Told Banks when I met'em I'm a ride
And if I gotta die, rather homicide
I ain't had 50 cent when ma grand-mama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with ma jacob on
See how time fly?
Hate it or love it the under dog's on top
And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop
Go'head'n envy me
I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't going no where
So you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the under dog's on top
And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop
Go'head'n envy me
I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't going no where
So you can get to know me
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real we aint gotta pretend
The cold world that we in
It's full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game
Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench
My Ma's happy, she aint gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the range
Thinking how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone, and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No school books
They use their wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in a booth
And I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion
I love you Ma
Hate it or love it the under dog's on top
And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop
Go'head'n envy me
I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't going no where
So you can get to know me
  When I am down and oh my soul so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
Then I am still and wait here in the silence
Until you come and sit awhile with me
You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be
There is no life no life without it's hunger
Each restless heart beat so imperfectly
But when you come and I am filled with wonder
Sometimes I think I glimpse eternity
You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be
You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
  Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then, just stay the same
So, don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are, yeah
I've been drained and I can't hide it;
but I have strenght for you,
I am coming home now,
From this moment, from this moment,
But my heart is strong,
It's you and I against the world,
From this moment, from this moment, (From this moment)
  There's a conclusion to my illusion
I assure you this
There's no end to this confusion if you let it wish you well
Soul to sell
Highest bidders, can't you tell what you're getting?
There is a light to all this darkness, I will tell you this
There's redemption in you asking them just why it is
Some answers are better left unspoken when you know you ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
You ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger

Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
You ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Why we fight to get on loving I've been wondering
How your mind will leave you hanging your heart lingering
Stay lost
Then found by whoever stays around forgetting
There is a way to be yourself, I assure you this
There's a way to catch your dreams without falling asleep
You might as well get it while you can, babe
'Cause you know you ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
You ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger

  Thank You
I dreamed I went to heaven
And you were there with me
We walked upon the streets of gold
Beside the crystal sea
We heard these angels singing
Then someone called your name
You turned and saw this young man
And he was smiling as he came
And he said friend you may not know me now
And then he said, but wait
You used to teach my Sunday School
When I was only eight
And every week you would say a prayer
Before the class would start
And one day when you said that prayer
I asked Jesus in my heart
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave
Then another man stood before you
And said remember the time
A missionary came to your church
And his pictures made you cry
You didn't have much money
But you gave it anyway
Jesus took the gift you gave
And that's why I'm here today
One by one they came
Far as your eyes could see
Each life somehow touched
By your generosity
Little things that you had done
Sacrifices you made
They were unnoticed on the earth
In heaven now proclaimed
And I know that up in heaven
You're not supposed to cry
But I am almost sure
There were tears in your eyes
As Jesus took your hand
And you stood before the Lord
He said, my child look around you
For great is your reward

  If your lips are moving, If your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are moving, If your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
Boy, look at me in my face
Tell me that you're not just about this Bass
You really think I could be replaced
Nah, I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl, I'mma hold it up
You're full of something but it ain't love
And what we got, straight overdue
Go find somebody new
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye
I know you lie
Cause your lips are moving
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, You gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you lie
Cause your lips are moving
Baby don't you know I'm done
If your lips are moving, If your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are moving, If your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
Hey baby don't you bring them tears
Cause it's too late, too late baby
You only love me when you're here
You're so two-faced, two-faced babe
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye
I know you lie
Cause your lips are moving
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, You gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you lie
Cause your lips are moving
Baby don't you know I'm done
Come on, say!
If your lips are moving, If your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are moving, If your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
(Alright now, I wanna hear ya'll singing with me)
I know you lie
Cause your lips are moving
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, You gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you lie
Cause your lips are moving
Baby don't you know I'm done
  It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty
We can spread our smile of joy
Feel your arms around the world at Christmas time
But say a prayer
And pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard
But while you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where a kiss of love can kill you
Where there's death in every tear
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight we're reaching out and touching you
Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa
A song of hope where there's no hope tonight (ooh)
Why is comfort to be feared,
Why is to touch to be scared
How can they know it's Christmas time at all
Here's to you
Raise a glass to everyone
Here's to them
And all there is to come
Can they know it's Christmas time at all
Feed the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Feel the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Feel the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Feel the world let them know it's Christmas time again
  I could have beer for breakfast
My sanity for lunch
Trying to get over how bad I want you so much
Innocence for dinner
Pour something in my cup
Anything and everything just to fill me up
But nothing ever gets me high like this
I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You're going straight to my head
And I'm heading straight for the edge
I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you
I can feel you whisper and laying on the floor
I try to stop but I keep on coming back for more
I'm a light-weight and I know it
Cause after the first time, I was falling, falling down
Nothing ever gets me high like this
I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You're going straight to my head
And I'm heading straight for the edge
I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you
Bittersweet ecstasy
That you got me in
Falling deep
I can't sleep tonight
And you made me feel like I'm out of my mind
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Bittersweet ecstasy
That you got me in
Falling deep
I can't sleep tonight
And you made me feel like I'm out of my mind
Oh but it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Nothing ever gets me high like this
I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You're going straight to my head
And I'm heading straight for the edge
I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you
Dear Slim,
I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
Dear Slim,
You still ain't called or wrote,
If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert you didn't have to,
We waited in the blistering cold for you
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I write you
I never knew my father neither,
Cause I don't really got shit else,
Hey Slim, I drank a 5th of vodka, dare me to drive?
You know that song by Phil Collins "In the air of the night"
About that guy who could've saved that other guy
From drowning, but didn't?
And Phil saw it all and at his show he found him?
I hope your conscious eats at you and you can't breathe without me!
See Slim? Shut up bitch, I'm trying to talk!
But I didn't slit her throat,
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more,
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
Dear Stan,
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
And here's an autograph for your brother:
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, c'mon, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan, why are you so mad?
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
  Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planets spinning
The force from the beginning
We've, come too far
To give up, who we are
So let's, raise the bar
And our cups, to the stars
She's up all night to the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky (x5)
The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?
You wanna leave I'm with it
We've, come too far
To give up, who we are
So let's, raise the bar
And our cups, to the stars
She's up all night to the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky (x5)
(We're up all night to get) (x6)
(We're up all night to get lucky) (x10)
We've, come too far (we're up all night to get lucky)
To give up, who we are (we're up all night to get lucky)
So let's, raise the bar (we're up all night to get lucky)
And our cups, to the stars (we're up all night to get lucky)
She's up all night to the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky (x9)
  Heart beats fast
Colors and prom-misses
How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
  Ny tid nalkas denna tid går mot sitt slut
Hela Stockholm ser mig krönas kanoner skjut salut
Ingen ed lagd ingen ed jag svär
Kronan kommer ej från kyrkan den kom direkt från Gud
Bevisat min styrka genom strid
Född att regera att föra krig
Knä om knä
Min tid är här
Över Norden jag härskar
Med det arv som jag gavs
Gång på gång sjung Carolus sång
Krigets konst jag behärskar
Låt mitt namn sprida skräck
Gång på gång sjung Carolus sång
Än en gång sjung Carolus sång
Född att härska leda mina män i strid
Ingen man kan mig befalla jag lyder under Gud
Hör min order ifrågasätt mig ej
Vet att sådan är min vilja och därvid skall det ske
Sida vid sida uti strid
Med karoliner går jag i krig
Knä om knä
Min tid är här
Över Norden jag härskar
Med det arv som jag gavs
Gång på gång sjung Carolus sång
Krigets konst jag behärskar
Låt mitt namn sprida skräck
Gång på gång sjung Carolus sång
Än en gång sjung Carolus sång
Allt jag ser vill ha mer vem ska stoppa mig
Hela Europa skall böja sig för min armé
Vad är ditt skall bli mitt då jag dräper dig
Min vilja ske
Bevisat min styrka genom strid
Född att regera att föra krig
Knä om knä
Min vilja ske
Över Norden jag härskar
Med det arv som jag gavs
Gång på gång sjung Carolus sång
Än en gång
Krigets konst jag behärskar
Låt mitt namn sprida skräck
Gång på gång sjung Carolus sång
Än en gång sjung Carolus sång
  You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Hell won't endure no more, so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
The Breathless moments
Breaking me down
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
  I left my home still as a child, I walked a thousand soary miles
To wait for my father, to gather up his tools
He said my boy you've got to run, don't wait for me, don't wait for mum
We'll come get you, when it's safe for us to move
So I waited many years, held back the pain behind my tears
For my father, to come find me like he said
And in that time I was alone, so many years without my home
I made brothers of a different kind instead
And at the time I didn't know, just how hard the wind could blow
Towards disaster, and the things that I would see
I never found my father, I never found my mother
Even would I know in my lifetime I will be
A hero into the masses, to those born without chances
There's a freedom that everyone deserves
I know there's greed and there's corruption
I've seen death and mass destruction
But I'm telling you, and I hope that I'm heard
I will not be commanded
I will not be controlled
And I will not let my future go on
Without the help of my soul
And I will not be commanded
And I will not be controlled
And I will not let my future go on
Without the help of my soul
And I will not be commanded
And I will not be controlled
And I will not let my future go on
Without the help of my soul
I will not be commanded
I will not be controlled
And I will not let my future go on
Without the help of my soul
  Together at last
Together forever
We're tying a knot
They never can sever
I don't need sunshine now to turn my skies to blue
You've wrapped me around
That cute little finger
You've made life a song
You've made me a singer, oh
You're not warm and fuzzy
And ain't the most shyest girl
Today was terrible
Today was a straight-up nightmare
But that was then
Cause I was looking for something
Looking for my loose end
No, I don't need anything but you
But that was then
Cause I was looking for something
Looking for my loose end
No, I don't need anything but you
But nothing on earth could ever divide us
But nothing on earth could ever divide us
But nothing on earth could ever divide us
But nothing on earth could ever divide us
Together at last
Together forever
We're tying a knot
They never can sever
You're two of a kind
The happiest pair now
Like bright shooting stars
You're floating on air now
And what's the title of the dream that just came true
I don't need anything
Anything
Anything
I don't need anything but you!
  Yeah ready for the summer
Girl your hair looks killa
See your batty getting bigger
Butyour waist looks slimmer
And i hope I'm still with you when your hair get thinner
I ain't gotta work it out i know I'm onto a winner
And I love it when i see you sing a song in the mirror
When you play your favourite records when there ain't no filler
Chicky cha chicky chicky sade j j dilla
Now I'm on the right track from the train to the limo
now we're on the right track (right track, right track)
Used to know me back in college now i got it like that
Could have got the side track now I'm back on my feet
If i hadn't achieved would you pack up and leave
Now you scratchin on me like we're Adam and Eve
Playing remix to ignition in the back of the jeep
She know i love her even if i never say the words
You were something i can't replace
You made my heart work
You make me stronger
I'm not letting go I'm not letting go (x2)
I'm not letting go I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go I'm not letting go
Livin in a bubble we ain't struggling in life
Ready for your trouble and a couple of fights
Why don't you stay over here and keep me up in the night
And when you comin in here I'll do you just like you like
Girl I'm ready for your loving Girl i keep on falling
You my lucky number that i keep on calling
Wanna never let me go she say she fed up of touring
Cause i kiss her in the night and then i leave in the morning
I tell her 1 already know she the 1
She's 22 we in le fountain blu
And when she's free you know she call on me
Then i make her take it off and put it all on me
Playing the sheets don't sleep tonight
Playing R Kelly I believe i can fly
She know i love her even if i never say the words
You were something i can't replace
You made my heart work
You make me stronger
I'm not letting go I'm not letting go (x2)
I'm not letting go I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go I'm not letting go
Oi my size i see you're quite shy
Guess I'm a sucker for those nice eyes
I ain't in it for the money or the fame
I'm the one all the honeys couldn't tame
yo i change
You makey heart work
You make me stronger
This thing we have
It can't be bought or sold
Now, you were something i can't replace
You made my heart work
You make me stronger
I'm not letting go I'm not letting go (x2)
I'm not letting go I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go I'm not letting go
  When I'm old and grown
I won't sleep alone, woah
Every single moment will be fading into you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
And I won't sing the blues
Cause all I need is you, woah
Every single question will be answered all by you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
When the world's on fire we won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
When were old and gray
And our faces changed
There won't be a moment when my heart don't feel the same
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
And every story ends
But we could still pretend
Every single moment will be just as we had planned
It was some type of love
That's some type of love
When the world's on fire we won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
If I'm here with you
I'll give me to you baby
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
When the world's on fire we won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

  Walk like i built this town
Steps so light, i barely touch the ground
Everybody wants to know how,
brick by brick i put them in the ground
W-w-walk like I built this
I do it for my people, family business
And everybody wants to know how
Take a good look, you will now witness
Wake up, wake up it's a brand new day
I got a fresh breath and a full plate
W-w-wake up, wake up up
This is not a game
I'll take my fresh breath and go my own way
Measure my growth by the season
Limits don't exist if you don't give them reason
but everybody wants to know how
I built this dream and never had a doubt
Walk like I built this town,
Everybody's coming at me now, now, now
I-I-I'm never coming down
This is what I live for
Don't look back
Don't look back at me
And act like I didn't tell you
Everything I'm about
Woohoo oohoo
I tell you what I live for,
I tell you what I life for
Wake up, wake up up
This is what I, this is what I, this is what I live for
W-w-wake up, wake up
This is what I, this is what I, this is what I live for
  No time to pretend
Dust off and try again
Straight out of lions den
Strong as a thousand men
That's what I've been told
Since I was six years old
Duck down and count to ten
I'm gonna hit the lotto
I'm gonna place my bet on every step I take
Go tell everyone under the sun
I'm on my way
And if I hit rock bottom
I'm gonna smile and dance with every step I take
Go tell everyone under the sun
I'm on my way
On my way
Go throw the key away
No matter what the say
All for a better day
You will always be the same
That's what I've been told
Since I was six years old
Duck down and count to ten
I'm gonna hit the lotto
I'm gonna place my bet on every step I take
Go tell everyone under the sun
I'm on my way
And if I hit rock bottom
I'm gonna smile and dance with every step I take
Go tell everyone under the sun
I'm on my way
On my way
Heaven and Earth have finally aligned
Days are good and thats they way it should be
You sprinkle star dust on my pillow case
It's like a mooning brushed across my face
nights are good and thats the way it should be
You make sing ooohhh la la laaa
You make a girl go oohhh oohhh
I'm in love, love
Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
Bright, so bright
And I see colors in a different way
You make what doesn't matter fade to grey
Life is good and that's the way it should be
You make sing ooohhh la la laaa
You make a girl go oohhh oohhh
I'm in love, love
Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
'Cause now I'm shining bright (oooohhh) so bright
And I get lost (ooohh) in your eyes
Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
Bright, so bright
Bright, so bright
And I get lost in your eyes tonight
  Ge mig arsenik (bapapapaa)
För stan är full av tanter och tragik
Pulver hjälpte mig, verkligen
Skriv det här i tidningen för jag var nere men uppe på fem (Aahahah)
Lillebror, (bapapapa) bli inte som jag när du blir stor
Du stod i dörren och sa: är det här allt som blir så dör jag
Lillebror, bli aldrig som jag (Aahahah)
Känn ingen sorg för mig Göteborg
Och Singoalla tror att om, himlen finns är jag förlorad
Men känn ingen sorg för mig Göteborg
På diskotek (bapapapa)
Men jag tar allting på lek även en hemlighet
Ta mig till kärlek ta mig till dans
Ge mig nåt som tar mig någonstans
För jag vill veta om kärlek finns
Känn ingen sorg för mig Göteborg
Och Singoalla tror att, om himlen finns är jag förlorad
Men känn ingen sorg för mig Göteborg
Känn ingen sorg för mig Göteborg
Det var en kväll på ett diskotek
Jag följde varje hennes danssteg
Vi kanske ses det finns en chans
(Vi kanske ses det finns en chans)
På nån spårvagn någonstans
Känn ingen sorg för mig Göteborg
Jag vet att alla tror att, om himlen finns är jag förlorad
Känn ingen sorg för mig Göteborg

  Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and then you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do
But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
(I won't hesitate)
Open up your mind and see like me
(No more, no more)
Open up your plans and man you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
(It cannot wait, I'm sure)
So please don't, please don't, please don't
(There's no need to complicate)
There's no need to complicate
(Our time is short)
'Cause our time is short
(This is our fate)
This is, this is, this is our fate
I'm yours
  I know a bot,
her name is Anna, Anna is her name
And she can ban, ban you so hard
She cleans up in our channel
I wanna tell you, that I know a bot
I know a bot,
her name is Anna, Anna is her name
And she can ban, ban you so hard
She cleans up in our channel
I wanna tell you, that I know a bot
That always watches everyone here
And makes us out of trouble
There is no Take-over that succeeds
Remember that it's I who know this bot
The bot that no one else can beat
And she kicks even if she shouldn't
She gets rid of everyone that "spams"
Yes, nothing can beat our bot
(Ready for take off)
(Are you ready?)
And then came the day I didn't think was real
The channel was out of control
I never thought I would be so wrong
When Anna said to me
"I'm not a bot,
I'm a really beautiful girl"
Which is, unluckily, now very strange to me
But nothing needs to be explained
Her name is Anna, Anna is her name
And she can ban, ban you so hard
She cleans up in our channel
I wanna tell you, that I know a bot
That always watches everyone here
And makes us out of trouble
There is no Take-over that succeeds
Remember that it's I who know this bot
The bot that no one else can beat
And she kicks even if she shouldn't
She gets rid of everyone that "spams"
I just want to be where You are,
dwelling daily in Your presence
I don't want to worship from afar,
draw me near to where You are
I just want to be where You are,
in Your dwelling place forever
Take me to the place where You are,
I just want to be with You
I want to be where You are,
dwelling in Your presence
Feasting at Your table,
surrounded by Your glory
In Your presence,
that's where I always want to be
I just want to be,
I just want to be with You
I just want to be where You are,
to enter boldly in Your presence
I don't want to worship from afar,
draw me near to where You are
Coda
Oh, my God,
You are my strength and my song
And when I'm in Your presence
Though I'm weak You're always strong
Ending
I just want to be
I just want to be with You

  Too shy baby baby
I'm right at your border
Hearts out masquerading
Why can't I come over
I wonder what you do
I'm looking at your perfect outlines
I wanna get with you
And get beyond your perfect outlines
Another one drops to pressure
Another dance in the dark
Another love undercover
Outlines of the heart
Another one drops to pressure
Another dance in the dark
Another love undercover
Outlines of the heart

It takes all your courage
To come any closer
Rise up silhouetting
Shoulder to shoulder
I wonder who are you
I'm looking at your perfect outlines
I wanna get with you
And get beyond your perfect outlines
Another one drops to pressure
Another dance in the dark
Another love undercover

I introduce you to the projects, I introduce you to the hood
I introduce you to the ghetto, I introduce you to Rick Ross
This for all my goons, reppin' on pills
Speedin' to make me run in your crib
Put they offer behind your wheel
Monkey suit, black mask, city boy gear
Slippin' got alot of niggas whacked this year
Been up two days straight homie no sleep
Ridin' with choppas lurkin' Fo' deep
Jumpin' out on the first thing look sweet
Double stacks got the goons grittin' teeth
Car full of throw away big boy heat
Two brand new K's hangin' off seats
Yeah it got me speedin' all week
G4 straight from the NO
We gettin' money stay fly 'til the next show
We got money stay fly 'til we get more
We got bitches high rollin' with this cash flow
Put the H in the hood
Put a 1 on the good put a slab on the wood
Me and Ross doin' good
100 million dollars nigga hangin' in the hood
I'm doin' donuts in the streets pedal to the glass
My lord of Murcielago max on the dash
Speedin' niggas can't see me in the blink of a flash
You got to slow motion to flick so you can see me when I pass
You know just what to do when you see me gettin' my cash
When I pull up drop the bags and? I'm doing the dash
No confusion understand no gimmicks
Duke is like the Autobahn disregardin' the speed limits
Fast life, fast broads, let's get it fast buddy
Fast food, fast cars we gettin' fast money
Fuck the talk we been doing this, heat it up
And when you bringin' me my cake you better speed it up
Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs, speedin, I'm speedin'
I can't stop it's all I know
From a youngin' I was taught get doe
I'm speedin', speedin', I'm speedin'
It's all a big ricky in my brand new Bentley
Doing above 50 fin' to get another mill' tickets
I ain't bein' funny I don't see the competition
Since a youngin' get the money all I ever comprehended
Business hall ass ball 'til you fall yeah
Y'all sit on y'all ass, now I see why y'all mad
I'm leaving y'all ass, I ain't seein' y'all ass
Never cross that line put 3 in y'all face
Country niggas playin' damn near 25
Who gon' pick them up pick up them up first flight
Call Ricky Ross hell yeah high five
Throw them in the trunk and I'll tape them to the fender
Scrapin' off the plate like a niggas eatin' dinner
I'm speedin' shorty you trippin'
If you see the blue lights homie I'm dippin'
Niggas want hood rep the hood back
Shit Joey the don they call me cooked crack
If you look at them wrong you get it pushed back
From rags to riches they never look back
I'm watchin' pelicans fly me and Rick racing Diddy on boats
Throwin' money in the air and you niggas just chumps
New york New York big city of dreams
I'm a hustla baby I'm addicted to cream
I'm talking money, cars, hoes, bitches
Cappadon suit let the feds take pictures
88 pose just me and my niggas
Thank god for that white if you feelin' religious
I grew up on the crime side the New York Times side
Nickel and dimes to survive
Fresh out the can million dollar plan
Tryin' to triple up that weed money nahh I'm sayin'
Precise with the white pirates a job my job to make it hard
Only way up out the hood rap crack or playin' ball
Ain't nobody touchin' the plate if I ain't eatin'
Fuck it hand me 220 on the dash let me see it
Rest in peace Chad Butler, I'll see you when I get there
But for now I'm doin' 90 in a cigarette with bitches
Lookin' back on last year laughin' at the mirror
I'm on TV I look a little clearer
You look a little worried chill and smell the money in the bag
I'm a crash too many hundreds on the dash
Trilla, Gun Play, Triple C I'm outta here
I got on the digital dash I go ghetto miles per hour no speed pass
I did know got my momma pregnant this fast
They said that he my daddy
It's good times junior last saw me was in a caddy
Speedin' this time the snitches won't tell
I was MTV when the ball dropped player
Tila in my Tequila before I struck out the 12
Big Apple with apple bottoms the haters can go to hell
Like a boy-yoing-yoing by smackin my tounge foward that i coudn't afford,
Alicia Keys wit the chords
I'm livin' life in the fast lane with no L's or brakes
Why should I care about tomorrow when I'm doin' it today
No insurance on the Chevy but it's ok
Tell them catch me if they can while I'm speedin' away
Ride in HOV, I'm sprayin' nitrous so they can't see me
See me I'm POE
Everytime I come around
And I would if I could but I can't slow down
What they need just to give a nigga life
Give him 20 years just to feed a nigga rice
Put me in a hoe just to let me see the light
There's some niggas out here free ain't even livin' right
Five star g's my car leased
If you got the heat puttin' H on the streets
Heroin haven heroin graven
You would think I was a heroin baby
It's a new year, new year, new money
New Louie shoes but they cost a few hundred
Left the tip case still bought them new Tommy's
Got more scrilla for niggas with new drama
Top way back left foot up out the Porsche
Right foot flat, I'm good up in the Porsche
Ohh there I go Shaq tryin' to pull up on the Porsche
But I burn that cop on my way to Opa-Locka
Brisco holla back I'll be at at here in fact
Like I left somethin' soon as I left somethin'
Told me go to diamonds and just go and Weezy F somethin'
Ferrari F run Lamborghini test run
Call me weather man I make it rain in my chest sunny
Got your honey I don't give a damn about the raps honey
Cash Money, Young Money never ever less money
All we do is get money all we do is bet money
All we do is let money, go and get money
Now that's money Young Weezzzzyyyyyyyyy Baby
And this was the remix babyyyyyyy
  I pray you'll be my eyes
And watch her where she goes
And help her to be wise
Help me to let go
Every mother's prayer
Every child knows
Lead her to a place
Guide her with your grace
To a place where she'll be safe
I pray she finds your light
And holds it in her heart
As darkness falls each night
Remind her where you are
Every mother's prayer
Every child knows
Need to find a place
Guide her to a place
Give her faith so she'll be safe
Lead her to a place
Guide her with your grace
To a place where she'll be safe
  There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish, you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish, you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
(You're gonna wish, you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish, you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish, you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish, you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
(You're gonna wish, you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish, you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish, you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
But you played it, you played it
You played it, you played it to the beat

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
Baby, baby, baby oooh

And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til

I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe

Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,
She made my heart pound,
it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
Baby, baby, baby oooh

And she got the hots for me, the finest thing i'd ever seen
But oh, no, no, she got a man and a son doh-oh, but that's okay
'Cuz I wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
Like a shortstop, pick up e'rything mama hittin'
And in no time I better make this with her mine and that's for sure
'Cos I-I never been the type to break up a happy home
But uh there's something 'bout baby girl, I just can't leave alone
So tell me, ma, what's it gonna be
She said, "You don't know what you mean to me,"
No matter what I do

The way you come through and holler, and swoop me in his two-seater
Now that's gangsta and I got special ways to thank ya,

But uh it ain't that easy for you to pack up and leave him
But uh you and dirty got ties for different reasons

Be your number one

If that's what you need
Be your everything

And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head, knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
'Cause I'm only human
I'm only human
I'm only human
Just a little human
I can take so much
'Till I've had enough
Cause I'm only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I'm only human
And I crash and i break down
your words in my head, knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
'Cause I'm only human

There's no place I'd rather be
Than on my surfboard out at sea
Lingering in the ocean blue
And If I had one wish come true
I'd surf till the sun sets
Beyond the horizon
A wiki wiki mai lohi lohi
Lawe mai i ko papa he'e nalu
Flyin by on the Hawaiian roller coaster ride
A wiki wiki mai lohi lohi
La we mai iko papa he na lu
Pi'i na nalu la lahalaha
O ka moana hanupanupa
Lalala i kala hanahana
Me ke kai hoene i ka pu'e one
Helehele mai kakou e
Hawaiian roller coaster ride
There's no place I'd rather be
Than on the seashore dry, wet free
On golden sand is where I lay
And if I only had my way
I'd play til the sun sets
Beyond the horizon
Lalala i kala hanahana
Me ke kai hoene i ka pu'e one
It's time to try the Hawaiian Roller coaster ride
Hang loose, hang ten, howzit, shake a shaka
No worry, no fear, ain't no biggie braddah
Cuttin' in, cuttin' up, cuttin' back, cuttin' out
Frontside, backside, goofy footed, wipe out
Looking for the wipeout
Let's get jumpin', surf's up and pumpin'
Coastin' with the motion of the ocean
Whirlpools swirling, cascading, twirling
Hawaiian roller coaster ride
There's no place I'd rather be
Than on my surfboard out at sea
Lingering in the ocean blue
And if I had one wish come true
I'd surf till the sun sets
Beyond the horizon
A wiki wiki mai lohi lohi
Lawe mai i ko papa he'e nalu
Flyin by on the Hawaiian roller coaster ride
A wiki wiki mai lohi lohi
La we mai iko papa he na lu
Pi'i na nalu la lahalaha
O ka moana hanupanupa
Lalala i kala hanahana
Me ke kai hoene i ka pu'e one
Helehele mai kakou e
Hawaiian roller coaster ride
  Aunque mis ojos
No te puedan ver
Te puedo sentir
Se que estas aqui
Aunque mis manos
No pueden tocar
Tu rostro señor
Mi corazon puede sentir tu presencia
Puedo sentir tu majestad
Mi corazon puede mirar tu hermosura
Puedo sentir tu gran amor
You know the roof on fire
We gon' boogie oogie oogie, jiggle, wiggle and dance
Light the roof on fire
We gon' drink drinks and take shots until we fall out
Light the roof on fire
Now baby give a booty naked
Take off all your clothes, and light the roof on fire
Tell her, tell her baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fire
I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm a fireball
(Fireball)
I came, I saw, I conquered
Or should I say, I saw, I conquered, I came
This little chico on fire and he no liar
While y'all slippin' he's runnin' the game
Now big bang boogie
Get that kitty little noogie
In a nice, nice little shade
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said
Walk this way
I was born in a flame
Mama said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best you never had
If you think I'm burning out, I never am
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
(Fireball)
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I don't care what y'all say
Cause as the world turns, y'all boys gon' learn
That chico right here don't play
That boy's from the bottom, bottom of the map
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said
Walk this way
I was born in a flame
Mama said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best you never had
If you think I'm burning out, I never am
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
(Fireball)
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
Now we're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
(Fireball)
I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fire
I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm a fireball
  No milk today, my love has gone away
The bottle stands for lorn, a symbol of the dawn
No milk today, it seems a common sight
But people passing by don't know the reason why
How could they know just what this message means
The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams
How could they know the palace there had been
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen
No milk today, it wasn't always so
The company was gay, we'd turn night into day
But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
Becomes a shrine when I think of you only
Just two up two down
No milk today, it wasn't always so
The company was gay, we'd turn night into day
As music played the faster did we dance
We felt it both at once, the start of our romance
How could they know just what this message means
The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams
How could they know a palace there had been
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen
No milk today, my love has gone away
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn
But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
Becomes a shrine when I think of you only
Just two up two down
No milk today, my love has gone away
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn
No milk today, it seems a common sight
But people passing by don't know the reason why
How could they know just what this message means
The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams
How could they know a palace there had been
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen
No milk today, it wasn't always so
The company was gay, we'd turn night into day
But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
Oh all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
Oh all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
  From the streets of Miami, to presenting at the Grammys
Con el multito de Jennifer, maybe now you understand me
Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat (x2)
Dale
We don't believe in defeat, that's why we're back for a threepeat
Hi Jenny, mira que esta loco
Yo me locomo como pastelitos de Coco
I get stupid on the beat, see wowo
I got mommies, mommies by the boatload
Yo tengo la carne y ella el mojo
I'm sayin' dale, she's screamin' "YOLO"
She's Little Red Riding Hood and guess whose el lobo (me la como)?
Whose name is globally known?
Whose name on the check and they're adding an O?
Whose name on the blimp when the world is yours?
Whose name on the schools, slam fo' sho'!
I know it's hard to understand how a boy grew to a man
Man turned to a brand
But guess what, here I am
Jenny from the block, let's rock
Yeah push me harder, I do the same
Boy I wanna feel you in every way
Don't even wonder it's just a game
We're rockin' body to body, let's go insane
I hit the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow
I'm in the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up, so live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stoppin' 'till we're done
Live it up, so live it up, live it up
Make love, don't fight
Turn up this mother and let it play (mami)
I know you like my bumper, don't be ashamed (que rico)
Don't even wonder it's just a game (mami)
We're rockin' body to body, let's go insane (que rico)
I hit the spotlight, all night, ready to go

Bet this on a Grammy
Maybe now you understand me
Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat (x3)
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up, so live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stoppin 'till we're done
Live it up, so live it up, live it up
With darkness and silence through the night
I'm searching and I'll melt into you
What a fear in my heart
But you're so supreme!
I'd give my life
In my time there'll be no one else
I'm still in a dream,
Snake Eater!
Someday you go through the rain
And someday, you feed on a tree frog
This ordeal, the trial to survive
For the day we see new light!
I'd give my life
In my time there'll be no one else
I'm still in a dream,
Snake Eater!
I am still in a dream,
Snake Eater!
  Here's a llama
There's a llama
and another little llama
Fuzzy Llama
Funny Llama
Llama Llama duck
Llama llama
cheesecake llama
tablet, brick, potato, llama
llama llama mushroom llama
llama llama duck
I was once a tree house
I lived in a cake
but I never saw the way
the orange slayed the rake
I was only three years dead
but it told a tale
and now listen little child
to the safety rail
Did you ever see a llama
kiss a llama
on the llama
llama's llama
tastes of llama
llama llama duck
Half a llama
Twice a llama
not a llama
farmer llama
llama in a car
alarm a llama
llama duck
is that how its told now
is it oh so old
is it made of lemon juice
doorknob, ankle, cold
Now my song is getting thin
I've run out of luck
Time for me to retire now
and become a duck
  Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you if you'd only care
You touched my heart you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind and that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
I am a dreamer and when I wake
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
I'm so hollow, baby
I'm so hollow
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow
I'm so hollow, baby
I'm so hollow
  Me me me me me me

Bum ba bummm buuummm

Bum ba bummm bummmm
Ba bu bu bum bummmmm
Ba bum bahhh bum bum

bada bum bum buummmm
uhhhhhhh
Feeling so clean, it don't get no fresher
Chillin' in the freezer when I'm under pressure
Chilling in the freezer when i'm under pressure
Can't handle this volume
Can't handle this
Can't handle this song
But you going bounce to this shit
Bounce to this shit
Bounce to this shit
Put your this face on, lemme see you bounce to this shit
Phone calling I'm pressing red
Only red cup that's in my hand
I ain't got the time, so why you asking
I got a flight to catch, I'm always traveling
They packing
Drivin' backwards through Rome in a Range Rover
You skatin' on thin ice, Anna Kournikova
Rap game Tony Danza with the hot handles
No tint on the glasses, Colonel Sanders
I can Las Vegas valet at the Wynn
The burly boys in the candy blueberry Benz
I done rock more ice than Michelle Kwan
Aw shit, look who it is: the white Barry Bonds
A heavy weight, you a feather weight
I can meditate, make my drum levitate
I used to go campin' in that inward flannel
Ghost stories over Versace candles
RiFF!
Put it on ice like the musicals
Shootin' for the top no Call of Duty though
I ain't thinkin' with my pecker
But when I am in advantage she know 'Mac a spender
So outlandish when they catching candies??
Women gettin' friendly treasure landin' pimpin'
And the windows tinted and this shit is bangin'
Leave this bitch there, goddamn
Chick with me and she far from dizzy
But she kinda dizzy from these round trips
And she talkin' money you don't hear a quip
Every last nigga
Makin' anthems with my lady
Going on tangents, making papers
Haters that play it just bring green
Two million and a half, Charlie Sheen
Wrist glisten and the neck glean
So supreme like sean stussy
So in any battle, ain't no better than losing
Chillin' in the freezer when I'm under pressure
  Light of the World
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes
Let me see
Beauty that made
This heart adore You
Hope of a life
Spent with You
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
King of all days
Oh, so highly exalted
Glorious in Heaven above
Humbly You came
To the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
  Yo, ayo tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we about to get lifted
Lift and the President gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time
The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young
The night is still young

And so are we
Ayo, drinks on you or the drinks is on me

If he sexy, he planking on me
So when them big boys want all of that
Tell the bartender, say my order back
It's bottle service, he ordered that
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leaving 'till we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is don't lose
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time
The night is still young
The night is still young

And so are we
  My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground, touch the ground,
And it feels like I can see the sands on the horizon
Everytime you are not around
I'm slowly drifting away, drifting away
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream
I wish I could make it easy, easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, I find a way, I'm stuck here in between,
I'm looking for the right words to say
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream
  Du, jag slänger ner en nyckel ifrån fönstret i köket
jag bor fyra trappor upp och du är välkommen in
Massa skor i hela hallen, folk vid fläkten som röker
Det är fest hos mig i kväll och hela världen är min
O, oh sång på sång
Det ekar över hela staden
Åh, nå't stort på gång
För det är kö från gatan upp till hallen
Och grannarna har klagat sedan kvart över tio
Nu är alla i mitt kök och jag är alldeles paj
Spelar pappas skiva ifrån '69
De sjunger "cosa vuol dir sona una donna ormai
O mare nero, o mare nero, o mare ne"
Sänker volymen, låter alla sjunga med
Kan inte tänka, jag står bara här och ler
O, oh sång på sång
Det ekar över hela staden
Åh, nå't stort på gång
För det är kö från gatan upp till hallen
Det ekar över alla taken
Ja, det är kö från gatan upp till hallen
Dunkande hjärtan klockan kvart över fem
Imma på rutorna men ingen går hem
Flackande blickar upp och ner och igen, åh
Ingen vet ifall det verkligen hänt
Ingen vet ifall det verkligen hänt
Imma på rutorna men ingen går hem, åh
Dunkande hjärtan klockan kvart över fem
Ingen vet ifall det verkligen hänt
Verkligen hänt
Sång på sång
Det ekar över hela staden
Åh, nått stort på gång
För det är kö från gatan upp till hallen
Det ekar över hela staden
För det är kö från gatan upp till hallen
  Här var det hoppsan hejsan,
Kan å kan du gissa,
kan du gissa vem jag är?
Vill å vill du veta
vad en sån som jag kan heta?
Strunta i att fråga
Här kommer Pippi Långstrump,
tjolahopp tjolahej tjolahoppsan-sa
Här kommer Pippi Långstrump,
Har du sett min apa,
Har du sett Herr Nilson,
Har du sett min villa,
min Villa Villekullavilla
Vill å vill du veta,
varför villan heter så ?
Jo, för där bor ju Pippi Långstrump
tjolahopp tjolahej tjolahoppsan-sa
där bor ju Pippi Långstrump,
Det är inte illa,
jag har apa häst och villa,
En kappsäck full med pengar
Kom nu, alla vänner,
varenda kotte som jag känner,
Nu ska vi leva loppan,
Tjolahej tjolahoppsan-sa
Här kommer Pippi Långstrump,
tjolahopp tjolahej tjolahoppsan-sa
Här kommer Pippi Långstrump,
  Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood,
You'll find the enchanted neighborhood,
But most of all Winnie the Pooh!
Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh,
He's Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh,
Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh,
  Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone-gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I'll take her home
I'd drive all night to keep her warm
-and time, is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning
I'll see us in the light upon the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still
And I'll be gone-gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I'll take her home
I'd drive all night to keep her warm
-and time, is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
And I been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life, I take her home
I'd drive all night to keep her warm
and time-Is frozen
The story of my life I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke inside (until she's broke inside)
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
  The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the Queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in; Heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back any more
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on, the cold never bothered me anyway
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand
And here I stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystalizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back,
The past is in the past
Let it go, let it go
When I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on,
The cold never bothered me anyway
  When you close your eyes,
you can see the day rewind,
all the laughs and stupid fights,
Just like a party breaks at dawn,
I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return in every song that is unsaid,
our memory is always within reach,
When you're feeling empty,
I will be the fuel you need,
to keep on pushing on down the lonely street
Home like headlights on the lawn,
I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return in every song that is unsaid,
our memory is always within reach,
I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return in every song that is unsaid,
our memory is always within reach,
  When I met you in the summer to my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love as the leaves turned brown
And we could be together baby, as long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now but you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
When I met you in the summer to my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love as the leaves turned brown
And we could be together baby as long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now but you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
When I met you in the summer, summer
Om du var vaken skulle jag ge dig
Men du, jag ger dig min morgon,
Du drömmer om något fint ,
Om du var vaken skulle jag ge dig
Men du, jag ger dig min morgon,
Om du var vaken skulle jag ge dig
Men du, jag ger dig min morgon,
Om du var vaken skulle jag ge dig
Men du, jag ger dig min morgon,
Men du, jag ger dig min morgon,
  Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
Anywhere I would have followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small
It was over my head, I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love, just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would have followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love, and I'm saying goodbye
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere I would have followed you, oh
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
  Killed by drones
My mother, my father
My sister and my brother
My son and my daughter
Killed by drones
Our lives between your fingers
Can you feel anything?
Are you dead inside?
Now you can kill
From the safety of your home with drones
Amen
  Ooh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
Ooh, I lost the feeling but I'm tryna hold on
I thought the end of love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore!
When there's no getting through, I won't hold back
I won't throw everything from the life way back then
I've been laying on the floor, sweeping on the ground
I would give up everything in life if I'd know how!
'Cause I can't stop wondering if I was too late,
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands on, look up into the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!
Ooh, when the moon was shinning bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shinning bright to coming rewrite back home
The lights in my eyes they disappeared,
A vision in my mind about to keep me from feel
I won't let it hold me down, the other way around
I don't want the words to I can't make a sound
'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands on, look up into the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!
Can't hold back, reaching out
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
Between us, I told you that
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, give it to you give it to you!
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!
Oh my, my, my, what you do to me
Like lighting when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
You put your body on top of mine
Every time that you lift me up
To the heavens and stars above
Oh lord have mercy
I'm begging you, please
I'm feeling drained
I need love
You charge me up
Like electricity
Jumpstart my heart
With your love
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I couldn't leave even if I wanted to
Cause something keeps pulling me back to you
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
The stroke of your fingers
The scent of your lingers
My mind roaming wild
The thoughts of your smile
Oh, you gotta give me some
Or you can give it all
But it's never enough no
Hold me in your arms
Burns like a fire
Electricity
When you're close I feel the sparks
Takes me higher to infinity
  The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice
He wraps himself in Light, and darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
Age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end
The Godhead Three in One
Father Spirit Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God (x2)
  If I'm stressing you out, why don't you go
You're wasting your time with your lies so
You've been breaking me down, now it's enough
'Cause you would do it again and again ohh
I hope that you'll be gone soon I can't take no more oh no
I will never fall for your lies again oh woah
I will never fall for your lies again oh woah oh
You shot me right in the face with a shotgun
You shot me right in the face with a shotgun
You shot me right in the
You shot me right in the
You shot me right in the
Face with a shotgun
Kill the motherfucking club
If I'm letting you down I'm letting you out
I'm wiping your dirt off my soul
You're talking a lot but you're pissing me off
What you try to say doesn't matter no more
I hope that you'll be gone soon I can't take no more no
I will never fall for your lies again oh woah
I will never fall for your lies again oh woah oh
You shot me right in the face with a shotgun
You shot me right in the face with a shotgun
You shot me right in the
You shot me right in the
You shot me right in the
Face with a shotgun
Face with a shotgun
Face with a shotgun

Allt som var dött, väcks till liv,
det kan också vi
Den gungar så tryggt in mot hamn
Lyser som guld, för kärlekens skull
Solen går upp, så oskuldsfull
Högt på ett berg står en katedral,
Men det är för himlen i dig,
och jorden i mig
Lyser som guld, för kärlekens skull
Solen går upp, så oskuldsfull
Lyser som guld, för kärlekens skull
Lyser på oss, för kärlekens skull
The dark days are gone, and the bright days are here
My life was torn like a windblown sand
Sunny
The dark days are gone, and the bright days are here
  Du är allt jag nånsin önskat
Du är allt jag nånsin drömt
Du är den som får mig minnas
Alla drömmar jag har glömt
Och du är den som får mig hoppas
Du är den som får mig le
All min kärlek får du bära
Hela livet vill jag ge
För du är där när ingen ser mig
Du är där när stormen yr
Du är där när natten skrämmer
Och du är där när dagen gryr
Jag vill alltid ha dig nära
När som åren läggs till år
Och vad livet vill oss lära
Är att framtiden är vår
Lalala,
När som klockorna har stannat
Och tiden tycks stå still
Och man inte vågar säga
Det man längst i hjärtat vill
Då ska vi ta varandras händer
Då ska vi minnas denna dag
Och förstå vad som än händer
Är det alltid du och jag
För du är allt jag nånsin önskat
Du är allt jag nånsin drömt
Du är den som får mig minnas
Alla drömmar jag har glömt
Och du är den som får mig hoppas
Du är den som får mig le
All min kärlek får du bära
All min längtan vill jag ge
Ja, all min kärlek får du bära
Hela livet vill jag ge
  Wow, wow, this way you gonna kill me
Oh, if I catch you
Oh, my God if I catch you
Delicious, delicious
This way you gonna kill me
Oh, if I catch you
Oh, my God if I catch you
Saturday at the party
Everybody started to dance
Then the prettiest girl past in front of me
I get closer and started to say:
Wow, wow, this way you gonna kill me
Oh, if I catch you
Oh, my God if I catch you
Delicious, delicious
This way you gonna kill me
Oh, if I catch you
Oh, my God if I catch you
  She says they're walking in a straight line
But that's not really her style
They all got the same heartbeat
But hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world could
Ever bring them down
Yeah, they're invincible
And she's just in the background
And she says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
He says I'm talking with a big smile
But they haven't got a clue
Yeah, they're living the good life
Can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars
But they don't know where they're going
In the fast lane
Living life without knowing
And he says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to get it
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
And they said
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to get it
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to get it
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
If she was a dime, I'd call her on the line
To come down and put it on me
It caused a scene when she burned into my atmosphere
Been on cloud nine but it's a matter of time
Till she gets released
Now I'll say she's been smoking since she landed here
I know what to say
But every time I'm with ya I want to get it
Every time I miss I want to hit it
I, I-I
And every other day I need it every other way
Every time I'm with ya I want to get it
Every time I miss, I want to hit it
How we get so, How we get so
High-I-I
We get so high, wooo
We get so high, So high
No lie
Its the hardest damn thing, I've tried to leave
And I'm hasty, cause I don't want to be that way
And it's a sign it's a matter of time till I get relief
Now I say it's so crazy how this happened to be
Dollar for a dollar, Nickel for a dime
I hold it all on the line
Every time I'm with ya I want to get it
Every time I miss, I want to hit it
I, I-I
And every other day, I need it every other way
Every time I'm with ya I want to get it
Every time I miss, I want to hit it
How we get so, How we get so
High-I-I
We get so high, wooo
We get so high, So high
High-I-I
Down,down,down,down,down
(ooo)
Going down
It's been five days, Three lives and
One too many times since we last kissed the sky
But this time, we're going down,down,down,down
Till I get so high
How we get so, How we get so
High-I-I
We get so high, wooo
We get so high, So high
High-I-I
So High x8
  I heard, that you're
Settled down that you
Found a girl and you're, married now
I heard, that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide, from the light
I hate to turn up
Out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me
It isn't over
Nevermind I'll find, someone like you
I wish nothing but the best, for you too
Don't forget me, I'll beg, I'll remember you say
"Sometimes it lasts in love"
"But sometimes it hurts instead"
"Sometimes it lasts in love"
"But sometimes it hurts instead," Yeah
You'd know how the
Time flies only, yesterday
Was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a, summer haze
Bound by the surprise, of our glory days
I hate to turn up
Out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me
It isn't over
Nevermind I'll find, someone like you
I wish nothing but the best, for you too
Don't forget me, I'll beg, I'll remember you say
"Sometimes it lasts in love"
"But sometimes it hurts instead," Yeah
Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes they're memories made
Who would have known how, bittersweet this would taste
Nevermind I'll find, someone like you
I wish nothing but the best, for you too
Don't forget me, I'll beg, I'll remember you say
"Sometimes it lasts in love"
"But sometimes it hurts instead"
Nevermind I'll find, someone like you
I wish nothing but the best, for you too
Don't forget me, I'll beg, I'll remember you say
"Sometimes it lasts in love"
"But sometimes it hurts instead"
"Sometimes it lasts in love"
"But sometimes it hurts instead"
  Let's hit the road
And away we go
Take a new direction
To a different coast
Maybe we should try and put it on the line
You gotta trust me now
Turn up the radio
Tune out the world and roll with the melody
Baby listen close and open up your mind
Imagine it, anywhere
More than miles
I'll take you there
Know one day from the sky, we'll be as one
Now here we are
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
Listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
Soundtrack in the wind
Like passing violins
I can be your rhythm in the silence
And every time we sing an echo's in the sky
Let me close your eyes
Help you fantasize
Make a kiss our playlist the entire night
Listen to the words and a letter flies
Imagine it, anywhere
More than miles
I'll take you there
Know one day from the sky, we'll be as one
Now here we are
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
Listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
Listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
  I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand,
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
And fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
And maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a Blue ray, true say
And now I always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you'd laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you'd lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try to get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe
To feel my heart against yours now, against yours now
'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up
Yeeeahhhh
Uhmmm
Light up, light up
Strike a match and watch the flames burn bright
Light up, light up
Breathe deep and let it clear your mind
When you start feeling down, light one up, pass it 'round
Keep your chin up and head high cause nothing's forever
Light up, light up
Breathe deep and put it in the sky
I'm never drinking and driving, I'm only smoking and flying
Too many dying, alcohol related death's multiplying
So you know, we gotta keep it in perspective
Get my point across, like a boss
and make sure that mi gente gets the message
I'm just gonna blow up on this fire, who got the lighter?
You want that sherbert OG Kush, that cookie gets you higher
Need no crazy pills, they give me no crazy thrills
That's just how I'm playa feels, I'm smoking until the wheels fall off
Yeah, and that's how we keep it lifted
California fine's are organically engifted
I'm in love with Mary Jane, some call it that Marichuana
I'm the one you call when you need that good ganja
Uuuuuh
Inhale, exhale, fucking right I love it
I got murder munchies , I'll die without chicken McNuggets
Used to buy bags, now I bring it back in buckets
The fuck is this a seed? My nigga, you must be bucking
I don't smoke less than OG Kush bitch
Y'all boys smoking on that bull shit
Probably ain't even coughing off none of that
If I was you, I wouldn't even much none of that
Can't even smell it when it's burning, that's that lil boy shit
I'm a grown man, I don't smoke with lil boys bitch
Super Sour Mix with that cookie
Plain RAW papers, or RAW paper cones
If I add a styrofoam cup I ain't gon' make it home
I'm just saying I'm so gone,
I don't even know where I'm suppose to be at
How the fuck we suppose to be sober
when Mary Jane everywhere we at
Cookie smoke in the air, there's police everywhere
Yeah I smoke where I want, now I don't really care
Will I share? I don't know
If I'm down? I'm in town for a week
Let's go half on that pound, yeah I only want that loud
Yo, we don't make a sound that ain't good
No swishas, no woods, bong hits if we could
Roll another one, think we should
You can smell it through the bag
I made it killing off the wax, so wanna take another dab?
  Through early morning fog I see
visions of the things to be
the pains that are withheld for me
that suicide is painless
it brings on many changes
I try to find a way to make
all our little joys relate
without that ever-present hate
The game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card I'll someday lay
The only way to win is cheat
And lay it down before I'm beat
and to another give my seat
The sword of time will pierce our skins
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in
A brave man once requested me
to answer questions that are key
is it to be or not to be
and I replied 'oh why ask me?'
'Cause suicide is painless
it brings on many changes
  I don't know just how it happened,
Guess I should have seen it coming,﻿
I wasn't looking where I was going,
I'm addicted to you,
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of,
Lost in your eyes,
Drowning in blue
Outta control,
What can I do?
I'm﻿ addicted to you!
When night blows in through the window,
Got me hypnotized,
I couldn't live without you now,
Oh, I know I'd go insane,
I wouldn't last one night alone baby,
I couldn't stand the pain!
I'm addicted to you!
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of,
Lost in your eyes,
Drowning in blue
Outta control,
What can I do?
I'm﻿ addicted to you!
  Besame, besame mucho,
Each time I cling to your kiss, I hear music divine,
Besame mucho,
This joy is something new, my arms enfolding you,
Whoever thought I'll be holding you close to me,
Dearest one, if you should leave me,
Besame, besame mucho,
Besame, besame mucho,
Besame, besame mucho,
Besame, besame mucho,

Aunque digan que soy
Un bandolero donde voy
Le doy gracias a Dios
Por hoy estar donde estoy
Y vo'a seguir con mi tumbao'
Y con mis ojos colorao'
Con mis gatos activao
Ustedes to' me lo han dao
Oye, a mi me importa poco lo que se diga de mi
William Landrón y yo somos socios de la avenida
Soy bandolero como el Mister Politiquero
Que se robo to' el dinero y lo postularon de nuevo
(Como si na'!) Si fuera Calde' o Don Omar
Nos daban conspiración, la llave bota'
Y yo no soy ejemplo, mi respeto a Tempo
Su único delito fue tener talento
Que tú quieres que yo escriba, guasimillas, mentiras
Yo estoy claro-claro, mis impuestos pago
Critican si trabajo, critican si soy vago
Y hago el primero, y me tratan de segunda
Así nenas les encanta como el negro zumba
Yo soy tu cuco, tengo el trabuco
Conocido mundialmente como el maluco
Aunque digan que soy
Un bandolero donde voy
Le doy gracias a Dios
Por hoy estar donde estoy
Y vo'a seguir con mi tumbao'
Y con mis ojos colorao'
Con mis gatos activao
Ustedes to' me lo han dao
Mira, diablo, que chereo
Me cogi un caso y apuntaron el dedo
Ya no era el rey del perreo
Ahora era tecato y otro posible reo
Que me metieran preso to's dijeron
Mal los veo, yo no les creo
A sus sistema de reformación ingrato
A mi me arrestaron dos puercos por pasar el rato
Y yo aquí pichando, aguantando, callando
Si nadie es perfecto, de que me están juzgando
De hacer con mi vida lo que cualquiera puede
Vivir como quiere, tener sus placeres
Mi gente, yo no soy distinto a ustedes
Y hoy en día soy cantante porque ustedes quieren
Me dieron la primera plana
"Cogen Rapero Con Marijuana, Pistolas, y Cosas Raras"
Solo quedare en su mente clara
Cuando crezcan donde yo crecí
Se críen donde me criaba
Diablo, me duele tanta baba
El no juzgarme se les agradece
El beneficio de la duda cualquiera merece
(Tío, el no juzgarnos se les agradece!)
(El beneficio de la duda cualquiera merece!)
Aunque digan que soy
Un bandolero donde voy
Le doy gracias a Dios
Por hoy estar donde estoy
Y vo'a seguir con mi tumbao'
Y con mis ojos colorao'
Con mis gatos activao
Ustedes to' me lo han dao
Oye, a la gente le encanta sacar pellejo
Unos por profesión, otros por bochincheros
Dale a la sin-hueso, so chicharronero
Haciendo dinero con el sufrimiento ajeno
Yo no soy un santo pero estoy en clave
Estoy pagando to' mis maldades
Y estoy aquí tirando pa' alante
Como quiera que lo pongas hago menos mal que antes
A ti lo que te jode es que te mataste
Trataste, te superaste, pero te olvidaste
Que el Papáupa esta mirándonos de arriba
El único que juzga, el único que no discrimina
Y yo no visto Armani ni Von Dutch
De calle y callejón, el bandido Calderón
El no juzgarnos se les agradece
El beneficio de la duda cualquiera merece

  You were my oppressor
And I, I have been programmed to obey
But now, you are my handler
And I, I will execute your demands
Leave me alone
I must dissociate from you
Behold my transformation
And you are empowered to do as you please
My mind was lost in translation
And my heart has become a cold and impassive machine
Leave me alone
I must dissociate from you
I won't let you control my feelings anymore
And I will never do as I am told
And I am no longer afraid to walk alone
Let me go
Let me be
I must stand free
From your grip
You will never own me again
Yeah
  Ay
Ay
Ay (Nobody likes to be played)
Oh, Beyonce, Beyonce
Oh, Shakira, Shakira
(Hey!)
He said, I'm worth it, his one desire
(I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about)
He kissed me, his one and only
(This) Beautiful liar
(Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about)
You'll never know
Why are we the ones who suffer
Have to let go
He won't be the one to cry
(Ay) Let's not kill the Karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it (Ha ha ha)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar
I trusted him
But when I followed you
I saw you together
(I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again)
I walked in on your love scene
Slow dancing
(You stole everything how can you say I did you wrong)
We never know
When the pain and heartbreaks over
Have to let go
The innocence is gone
(Ay) Let's not kill the Karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it (Ha ha ha)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar
Tell me how to forgive you
When it's me who's ashamed
And I wish I could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame
(Hey!)
Ay, Beyonce, Beyonce
Ay, Shakira, Shakira
Oh, Beyonce, Beyonce
Oh, Shakira, Shakira
(Hey!)
(Ay) Let's not kill the Karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it (Ha ha ha)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

  Johnny var Evas hjärtas låga
Han var solen när det dagas
Han var parken när det våras
och vi satt på gräset
Som växte i takt med himlen
Bengen drog förbi sen
Bengen trålar än
Johnny du och jag borde starta upp ett band
låta det explodera i skyn
Det är svårt att inte gråta
När jag tänker på oss två nu
För du var solskenet
Och jag var ensam
Johnny med amfetaminet
Satte mig i baksätet
Du tog mig på en tur
Radion var på
Kan du digga de e locomotion
För mycket revolution
Johnny jag gillar dig
Du har ett svart moln över dig
och vi red på Malmö city en måndagmorgon
Femton bilar, femton rastlösa truckchaufförer
freakin' doktorer, tjugofem konstaplar i gathörnen
Och du var solskenet
Johnny jag var ensam
Du var solskenet
Johnny jag var ensam
När jag höll på att drunkna
Tänkte jag på dig
Du sa att du ville dö
Du grät bakom dörren
och jag låg under sängen
Jag hörde dig
Eva jag behöver dig
Mer än vad jag vill ha dig
och jag vill ha dig för gamla tiders skull
Du betydde inte allt
Men det blåste aldrig kallt
För du var solskenet
Jag var ensam
Du var alldeles runt hörnet, i kvarteret
Du var alldeles runt hörnet, i kvarteret - Överallt
I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work work work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills
All these bills piled up on my desk
They looking like a mountain (Everest)
All the little kids runnin' 'round you can hear their stomachs growlin'
There's a full moon out, and my girl just keep on howlin'
Says she gon' leave me if I don't come home with 50 thousand (50 thousand?)
God damn, god damn, god damn
Oh man, oh man, oh man
God damn, oh man, god damn, oh man
Woke up and I bumped my head
Stubbed my toe on the edge of the bed
Opened the fridge and the food all gone
Neighbor's damn dog done crapped on my lawn
Hopped in the car and the car won't start
It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk
Behind an old lady in the grocery line
Praying that my card don't get declined
And my shoes, my shoes
I said my shoes!
Ain't got no soul
  3, 6, 9
The goose drank wine
The monkey chew tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat
Clap pat - clap pat - clap pat - clap slap
Cross it with your left arm
Pat your partner left palm
Pat your partner right palm
And a right palm again
My Mother told me
If I was goody
That she would buy me
A rubber dolly
My Auntie told her
I'd kissed a soldier
Now she won't buy me
A rubber dolly
3, 6, 9
The goose drank wine
The monkey chew tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat
Clap clap!
Clap your hands and prepare to pat
Clap!
Take your right arm
Pat your partner palm with your right palm
Clap!
Take your hand back and clap
Clap!
Take your right arm
Cross your right arm with your left arm
Pat your partner left palm with your left palm
Clap!
Now back with a clap
Take your hand to your palm and slap your thigh
And watch the fun materialize
As you sing this little song:
My Mother told me
If I was goody
That she would buy me
A rubber dolly
My Auntie told her
I'd kissed a soldier
Now she won't buy me
A rubber dolly
Clap!
Clap pat - clap pat - clap slap
Clap pat!
Clap pat - clap pat - clap slap
  Skies spin their dance
Within Your breath
Time runs its race
Within Your hand
And my mind runs wild
To comprehend
What no mind on earth
Could understand
Your ways are higher
Your thoughts are wilder
Love came like madness
Poured out in blood - wash romance
It makes no sense but this is grace
And I know You're with me in this place
Here now
All I know is I know that You are
Here now
Still my heart
Let Your voice be all I hear now
Spirit breathe
Like the wind come have Your way
Cause I know Your're in this place
Faith makes a fool
Of what makes sense
But grace found my heart
Where logic ends
When justice called
For all my debts
The Friend of sinners
Came instead
Here now
All I know is I know that You are
Here now
Still my heart
Let Your voice be all I hear now
Spirit breathe
Like the wind come have Your way
Cause I know that You are here now
Heart and soul
God I know that You are here now
Fix my eyes
On the things that I can't see now
And all I see
Is the glory of Your Name
  She wakes up early every morning
Just to do her hair now
Because she cares yeah
Her day oh wouldn't be right
Without her make up
She's never without her makeup
She's just like you and me
But she's homeless, she's homeless
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
In my sleep I see her begging
Preaching please
Although her body is not mine
I ask now why God why
She's just like you and me
But she's homeless, she's homeless
As she stands there singing for money
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
She's just like you and me
As she stands there singing for money
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da

La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da

  I'm on a mission, resuming transmission that checked out for too long
Was put into submission 'til I wrote down it all
But the truth is I cannot be trusted with what's in my head
Soon the crowd's position's braced with getting out of bed
Wake up and pay my dues 'til I'm blue in the face
Falling in line with the rest 'til I'm out of the race
But I'm losing it over nothing, just clearing space
You can only dance with the darkness when dawn takes place
'Cause we're just a speck in this world and they say "take it or leave it"
Short on stardust, but there's still time
I needed you to hear me out and free me from all my doubts
Now you found me
I can't feel you but there's still time
Yeah, it doesn't mean when I am low
No one's ever been this close, can you hear me?
It's not easy to change in a world of chaos
'Cause in layman's terms I was the big boss
Choking down the last of my entitlement
I kiss the ring goodbye while we're still young
But follow through in the light of it
I thank my lucky stars for this life of ambition
I have you and the life of a musician
Push the reset button, reboot up and take what you get
Let love in, take care of the rest of it
'Cause we're just a speck in this world and they say "take it or leave it"
Short on stardust, but there's still time
I needed you to hear me out and free me from all my doubts
Now you found me
I can't feel you but there's still time
Yeah, it doesn't mean when I am low
No one's ever been this close, can you hear me?
Can you hear me now?
Short on stardust, but there's still time
I needed you to hear me out and free me from all my doubts
Then you found me
I can't feel you but there's still time
Yeah, it doesn't mean when I am low
No one's ever been this close, can you hear me?
  Ave Maria!
Jungfrau mild,
Erhöre einer Jungfrau Flehen,
Aus diesem Felsen starr und wild
Soll mein Gebet zu dir hin wehen,
Wir schlafen sicher bis zum Morgen,
O Jungfrau, sieh der Jungfrau Sorgen,
O Mutter, hör ein bittend Kind!
Ave Maria!
Ave Maria
Unbefleckt!
Wenn wir auf diesen Fels hinsinken
Zum Schlaf, und uns dein Schutz bedeckt,
Wird weich der harte Fels uns dünken
Du lächelst, Rosendüfte wehen
O Mutter, höre Kindes Flehen,
O Jungfrau, eine Jungfrau ruft!
Ave Maria!
Ave Maria!
Reine Magd!
Der Erde und der Luft Dämonen,
Von deines Auges Huld verjagt,
Sie können hier nicht bei uns wohnen
Wir woll'n uns still dem Schicksal beugen,
Da uns dein heilger Trost anweht;
Der Jungfrau wolle hold dich neigen,
Dem Kind, das für den Vater fleht!
Ave Maria!

  Den vackraste stunden i livet var den när du kom
och allt var förbjudet
och allt som vi gjorde den stunden vill jag göra om
för det ekar i huvet'
och det blod som jag trodde var stilla det fick du att rinna,
den uppgivna röst som jag nyttjat så illa fick du att försvinna
O jag somnade den natten i tron på att allt var en del
i en kärlekshistoria
men det visa' sig dagen därpå att jag hade gjort fel
när jag gav dig en gloria
Och den stund som jag kände som nära var blott alvedon
och dom himmelska ben som jag ville förtära dom gick
där ifrån
Kom änglar, kom älvor det börjar bli kallt
graderna sjunker så fort överallt och det hjärta som skulle
bli ditt på nåt vis det fryser nu sakta till is
Och du somna' den natten så vaken och drömde om allt
som vi kunnat göra
O om någon som vill ge dig värme när allting känns kallt,
o om nån att beröra
Och jag kunde ha gjort vad som helst för att höra den tanken
men själv låg jag tyst i min säng och så frälst av den farliga branten -
jag liksom föll över kanten
Så kom änglar, kom älvor det börjar bli kallt
graderna sjunker så fort överallt och det hjärta som skulle
bli ditt på nåt vis det fryser nu sakta till is
Och den jävligaste stunden i livet var den när du gick
och allt var förlorat
O där satt jag med mina grön-bruna ögon och såg med blåögd blick
allt jag hade förstorat
För så kom änglar och ta mig till henne och ge mig en chans
för jag tror att snart brinner ett hjärta för henne någon annan stans
Kom änglar, kom älvor det börjar bli kallt
graderna sjunker så fort överallt och det hjärta som skulle
bli ditt på nåt vis det fryser nu sakta till is
Kom änglar, kom älvor det börjar bli kallt
graderna sjunker så fort överallt och det hjärta som skulle
bli ditt på nåt vis det fryser nu sakta till is
Kom änglar, kom älvor det börjar bli kallt
här sitter jag och baddar såren med salt
det går åt helvete med allt
  We, We don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They, they're gonna see us from outer space
Outer space, light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race
When the lights started out
They don't know, what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love, to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up, to the sky
'Cause we got the fire-fire-fire
Yeah we got the fire-fire-fire
And we gonna let it burn-burn-burn-burn
We gonna let it burn-burn-burn-burn
Gonna let it burn burn-burn-burn
We gonna let it burn burn-burn-burn
We don't wanna leave, no, we just gonna be right now
R-R-R-Right now and what we see, is everybody's on the floor
Acting crazy getting loco 'till the lights out
Music's on, I'm waking up, we stop the vibe, and we bump it up
And it's over now, we got the love
There's no sleeping now, no sleeping now (Sleeping now)
When the lights started out
They don't know, what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love, to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up, to the sky

Yeah we got the fire-fire-fire, and we gonna let it burn
  It's dangerous to fall in love behind
Wanna burn with you tonight
Your heart and me
There's two of us
We're certain with desire
The pleasure is pain and fire, burning
So come on now
I'll take you one
Take you one, hey
Hate for love, in for us, wild
To come, does it come a little closer?
So come on now
Strike the match
Strike the match now
A perfect match
Perfect somehow
I will never want another
Calling on, I'll blow who's fast
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
I can barely breath
And you feel love for me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I got on a knee
When you came back for me
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
I can barely breath
And you feel love for me
Fire meet gasoline
Burning tonight
And we will rise
Rise more dark now than the sky
I'll meet on the drive
Take on fire
So come on now
Strike the match
Strike the match now
A perfect match
Perfect somehow
I will never want another
Calling on, I'll blow who's fast
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
I can barely breath
And you feel love for me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I got on a knee
When you came back for me
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
I can barely breath
And you feel love for me
Fire meet gasoline
Burning tonight
But it's about best, certainly
But I want what I want, and I gotta get it
When the fire dies
Dark in the skies
Hot ash, and max on the smoke till love
But it's about best, certainly
But I want what I want, and I gotta get it
When the fire dies
Dark in the skies
Hot ash, and max on the smoke till love
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline

I'm burning alive
I can barely breath
And you feel love for me
Fire meet gasoline

Fire meet gasoline
Burning tonight
Burn wide tonight
Burn wide tonight
Burn wide tonight
Eh eh
  Snoriga armar och en randig kind
glömmer aldrig bort min tonårssynd
hemmafester och en stulen bil
jag satt vid fyrisån och döda tid
Snurra flaskan
jag har aldrig
sanning eller konsekvens
vad vill du veta om mig?
fråga bara
jag berättar vad som helst
Det var 17 år
17 år i staden där jag växte upp och så
märker du hur fort det går?
och jag var 17 år ville inte va den
som blev kvar
Jag har slitit ut så många skor
i en stad där ingen längre bor
hjälpte till på min brorsas restaurang
mina vänner ville va som han
Valborgskaos på stora torget
rackarberget '95
vi bodde högst upp
vad mer vill du veta
jag berättar vad som helst
Det var 17 år
17 år i staden där jag växte upp och så
märker du hur fort det går?
och jag var 17 år ville inte va den
som blev kvar
Jag minns det än idag
en vattenfestival
minns att ingen ville åka hem
jag skulle utomlands
jag bytte efternamn
och jag blev en av dom som aldrig kommit hem
Sen jag var 17 år
17 år i staden där jag växte upp och så
märker du hur fort det går?
och jag var 17 år ville inte va den
som blev kvar
jag ville inte va den som blev kvar
jag ville inte va den som blev kvar
  I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
Cuz everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
But don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl I'm not gunna waste it
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gunna waste my lies
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know your trying to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Tryin to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cuz she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk to much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You coulda rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Coulda walked away
But your still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
  Who am I, what have I become?
Do I stand for something, or for money?
Who am I, where's my good girl gone?
Who am I, now that my armor's worn?
Who am I, now that my heart has won?
But I've got today, I've got to make,
'Cause yesterday is dead and gone,
I want to start again, so I'll look within
Remember when I'd want in?
'Cause I don't know who I've become
Who am I, about to meet myself?
I want to start again, so I'll look within
Remember when I'd want in?
'Cause I don't know who I've become
'Cause yesterday is dead and gone
And me along with it
I want to start again

When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
Darkness all around, I hope that I could fly
And I sing along, I sing along
And I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
Cause I look around me and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
But you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
I can't stop my heart
When you're shining in my eyes
I can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
But you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhh
Gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flashlight
I got all I need when I got you and I
Cause I look around me and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
But you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me through the night
We belong
Can't stop my heart
When you're shining in my eyes
I can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
But you're my flashlight
You're gettin me through the night
We belong
Cause you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me through the night
  I get caught in the water
I get torn in the wind
I could drown in the river
While the sun burns dim
I get tossed by the ocean
Piled deep in the sand
I'm drowned out by the thunder
Lost in a laugh
Is anyone listening?
Is anyone around to see?
That I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go
I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go
Twenty-five seconds
Your heart'll stop resting
Your body starts shaking
Your mind's now ready to go
Ready to go
Twenty-five seconds
Your heart'll stop resting
Your body starts shaking
Your mind's now ready to go
Ready to go
I said twenty-five seconds
Your heart'll stop resting
Your body starts shaking
Your mind's now ready to go
Ready to go
  Somliga går med trasiga skor
Säg, vad beror det på?
Gud fader som i himmelen bor
Kanske vill ha det så
Gud fader som i himmelen bor
Blundar och sover sött
Vem bryr sig om ett par trasiga skor
När man är gammal och trött?
Vem bryr sig om hur dagarna går?
De vandrar som dem vill
Medborgare om etthundra år
Finns du ej längre till
Då har nån annan tagit din stol
Det vet du inte av
Du känner varken regn eller sol
Ner i din mörka grav
Vem bryr sig om hur nätterna far?
Jag bryr mig inte ett spår
Bara jag får ha mitt ansikte kvar
Dolt i min älsklings hår
Jag är en tvivelaktig figur
Duger ej mycket till
Bakom ett hörn står döden på lur
Han tar mig när han vill
Somliga går med trasiga skor
Tills de har slutat gå
Djävulen som i helvetet bor
Får sig ett gott skratt då
  From the very very first time when my body jam you girl

Je veux me perdre dans le flow de tes mots
Etre enivrée par l'odeur de ta peau
Chérir chaque instant passé dans tes bras
Baby désormais je n'appartiens qu'à toi
Tu pourras faire c'que tu veux de moi
Je te donne mon coeur mon ame
Pour tes caresses j'emploierai tous mes charmes, baby,
Le son résonne, je m'abandonne
Et je frissonne au son de ta voix
On est seuls au monde, les sentiments m'inondent
Je ne passerai plus un instant loin de toi
Je te suivrai où tu voudras jusqu'à ce que j'en perde le nord
Je te dirai encore et encore
Que ma vie n'a plus d'importance
quand mon corps s'éloigne de ton corps
Près de toi tout s'emballe, je ne peux plus résister
Perdue dans le brouillard j'n'essaye plus de lutter
Je m'envole avec toi dans un tourbillon de baisers
Tu occupes mes rêves et chacune de mes pensées
Am the one who's searching
You're the one am calling
Other guys dey halla for your swagalicious fire
Sunny day or rainy day no matter the forecast oo
Fine girl me and you would be together
Baby pour toi je ferai beaucoup de sacrifices
Je serai ta belle, baby je serai ta miss
Je rendrai réel le moindre de tes délices
Doctor tell me what I would do
See my temperature rising aaaa aaa
Na lovinjitis aaaa
  All we need is a July hot Saturday night
A couple cans all cool and the needle on full and a countryside
Yeah, a hot little playlist, of your favorite songs
When I get you climbing up in the cab of this truck
Yeah you know it's on, know it's on
Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
So give me that aw yeah, and take me there look
I'm a sucker for your kiss
Wanna steal 'em from your lips baby, like a crook
Foot heavy on the floorboard, everywhere we go
I'm talking once in a lifetime, blowing your mind
Burning down these back roads
Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
So give me that aw yeah, and I'll give you that all night
Girl, give me that let's go, and I'll give you that good good time
Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
Yeah, a once in a lifetime night
Ooh girl, looking down the ride of one hell of a night
I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
Didn't I warn you not to?
Didn't I warn you good?
Maybe we couldn't help it
Maybe we never should
Didn't I say it slowly?
Didn't I make it clear?
Is it unfair to ask you?
Why it is you're still here?
You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, singing
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I've bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name
Didn't I make it harder?
Didn't I leave you that?
Was it too much to ask you?
Why it is you still care?
You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, singing
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I've bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name
Come back, baby at times I'll cut you up and never let go
Sweet love, play your song
Call your mother, say take me home
Like your smile, don't say not
Another man down if you let them know
You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, singing
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I've bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name
When I think upon your goodness;
And Your faithfulness each day
I'm convinced it's not because I am worthy -
But I'm grateful for your mercy,
and I'm grateful for your grace
And because of how You've poured out Yourself,
I have come to sing this song out in praise
Imela, Imela (Thank You! Thank You!)
Okaka, Onyekeruwa (Great and Might creator of the world)
Imela, Imela, (Thank You! Thank You!)
Eze m Oh (My King)
Who am I to sing Your praises?
Who am I to worship You?
It's Your blood that makes the difference in me
And made a way to enter into Your throne
I could not come near Your presence
I could never sing Your song
But the sacrifice on Calvary's tree
is the reason I can cry out today
  I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but,
I got a hard rush
It's not slowing down
I got it real bad
I want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's giving you now
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, cuz they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blond hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, cuz maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peace
Thinking about her
Under your bed sheets
The way that she's whispering
The way that she's pulling you in
Lord knows I've tried,
I can't get her off my mind
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, cuz they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blond hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, cuz maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a hard rush,
  Let me escape in your arms
Baby I'm yours, baby I'm yours
Love don't come easy at all
I missed you so much, I missed you so much
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, woah
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we can be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the skies
Someday soon, we'll be together
He was a dreamer at heart
Chasing the stars, chasing the stars
Wings spread to the sun
I miss you so much, I miss you so much
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, woah
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we can be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the skies
Someday soon, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we can be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the skies
Someday soon, we'll be together
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we can be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the skies
Someday soon, we'll be together
  Maybe
You don't have to smile so sad
Laugh when you're feeling bad
I promise I won't
Chase you
You don't have to dance so blue
You don't have to say I do
When baby you don't
Just tell me
The one thing you never told me
Then let go of me
Hell just throw me
Maybe if you wanna go home
Tell me if I'm back on my own
Giving back a heart that's on loan
Just tell me if you wanna go home
Oh maybe
You don't have to kill so kind
Pretend to ease my mind
When baby you won't
Oh sugar
You don't have to be so sweet
I know who you're going to meet
Don't say that I don't
So maybe
I won't let your memory haunt me
I'll be sleepwalking
With the lonely
If you're taking me home
Tell me if I'm back on my own
Giving back a heart that's on loan
Just tell me if you wanna go home
Tell me if you wanna go home
Cause I'm just not sure
Tell me if I'm back on my own
How to get back there
Giving back a heart that's on loan
And I just can't bear
Tell me if you wanna go home
If you're not there
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Baby
If you're taking me home
Tell me if I'm back on my own
Giving back a heart that's on loan
Tell me if you wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna
Cause I'm just not sure
How to get back there
And I just can't bear
If you're not there
Tell me if you wanna go home
Cause I'm just not sure
Tell me if I'm back on my own
How to get back there
Giving back a heart that's on loan
And I just can't bear
Just tell me if you wanna go home
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna
Wanna go, wanna
Wanna go, wanna
If you're waiting for the moment, here it is
If you're aiming for the heart then you can't miss
You wanna know oh oh oh oh, where's the love
Here it is
Where's the love, where's the love
Here it is
Yeah I'm back like Thriller, get up
Ready for the build up
Sinner baby I'm no saint
I'm a stone cold winner, picture money where your mouth is
They can never break my bank
But the way you go, go now baby now you've got it
Turn around, you know that I want it
There's only really one thing that I gotta know-ow
Where in the world you're dropping it
I got the dollars and I'm ready to sponsor it
I got the guava with the cheese, no laundering
Give you that XO freebie
Let's go, repeat
Come and get some of this L-O-V-E
You know what I want, I know you need
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Let me tell you now
Hey now I can tell
You the one I wanted from a mile away
Ain't nobody looking like you up in here
Good times written all over your face
Yeah cause the way you show
Show me, show out, show me all your talents
Whoa now, throw me all of balance
Ay good girl, I'm a real bad habit
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Ain't no debate I'm heaven sent
I'm bout to take you to the places you've never been
Keep you up all night, I'm Letterman
Sick with it, I'ma bring you the medicine
You wanna do it all day
I give you the Flo and I let you ride it baby
Good lovin' don't play, give me the show
Oh yeah I like the way you roll roll roll it
Keep the party going
There's really only one thing I gotta know-oh
  Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh take, take, take it all, but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
cause what you don't understand
Is I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah yeah)
Oh-oh I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
No, no, no, no-oh
Black, black, black and blue beat me till I'm numb
Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman that's just what you are, yeah
You smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love
Is all I ever asked cause what you don't understand
Is I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah yeah)
Oh-oh I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
If my body was on fire
Ooh you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me you're a liar
Cause you never ever ever did baby
But darlin' I'd still catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Oh-oh I would go through all this pain, yeah
Take a bullet straight through my brain
No you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same Ooh
You'd never do the same
  Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, BLOW!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't colapse on him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You want it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You want it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post-mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, god only knows he's grown farther from home
He's no father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You want it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You want it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin', stepped writin' the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life, and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
Teetertotter caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go with my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You want it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You want it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

  You can take a swing at my ego,
Even with an army of people
You can aim your evil right at us,
Even if your stand makes me nervous,
There'll be no need for crying
We'll go on forever like the phoenix
This world is ours tonight
We'll go on forever like the phoenix
You can take a swing at my ego,
Even with an army of people
You can aim your evil right at us,
Even if your stand makes me nervous,
There'll be no need for crying
We'll go on forever like the phoenix
This world is ours tonight
We'll go on forever like the phoenix
  I wanna meet a friend
In a bar tonight
The evening is long
So long I hardly move
A can in my hand
A picture in my mind
A voice I need to hear,
A laugh I need to show
We're lonely, babe
In a boat, again
I need to see a friend tonight
Or see the people in a bar
I wish they could not see me at all
How I wish I could describe their pain
Or my pain
The mystic light, the choir of smoke
The smell of wood, the pose, the joke
The dirty little world inside
That needs to come out
Needs to come out
I wanna meet a friend
In a bar tonight
The evening is long
If only I had that strength
To see those people,
All so lonely as me
All so lonely,
All so lonely as me
  What is the purpose of tonight my baby
it's my fortune domain act
I need to feel where you're my baby
Are you ready to create
Something new
I don't want it to be a sign
let me take you away
Can't you see the light
I guess we found our way
I love to see your smile
All your faces stark again
Can't you see the light
I guess we found our way
I love to see your smile
All your faces stark again
I don't want it to be all the same
What is the purpose of tonight my baby
it's my fortune domain act
I need to feel where you're my baby
Are you ready to create
Something new
I don't want it to be a sign
let me take you away
Can't you see the light
(Can't you see the light)
I guess we found our way
(I guess we found our way)
I love to see your smile
(I love to see your smile)
All your faces stark again
I don't want it to be all the same
  What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Are you waiting on a lightning strike?
Are you waiting for the perfect night?
Are you waiting till the time is right?
What are you waiting for?
Don't you wanna learn to deal with fear?
Don't you wanna take the wheel and steer?
Don't you wait another minute here
What are you waiting for?

Don't you wanna spread your wings and fly?
Don't you really wanna live your life?
Don't you wanna love before you die?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you got
You only living once so tell me

  Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like oooooh,
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, ohh,
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like oooooh,
Mmm, too young, too drunk to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
  Mo' money, mo'-mo' money
Mo' money, mo' problem
Oh yeah
If I was flipping burgers on the night shift, would you choose me?
Would you let me take you home if I drove a hooptie?
Cause every time I see you, I be screamin' "Hallelujah"
But you're all about the Benjamins, I see right through ya
I'm still gonna get stoned
So you could go ahead and break your bones
Cause all I've ever been told
Mo' money, mo' problems, so I'd rather be broke
And all my people say, whoo
And all my people say, whoo
Mo' money, mo' problems
So I'd rather be broke
You just want one thing
My love ain't enough
I was so busy tryna make this shit last
That I didn't notice she was kissing my cash
Cause every time I see you, I be screamin' "Hallelujah"
But you're all about the Benjamins, I see right through ya
I'm still gonna get stoned
So you could go ahead and break your bones
Cause all I've ever been told
Mo' money, mo' problems, so I'd rather be broke
And all my people say, whoo
And all my people say, whoo
Mo' money, mo' problems
So I'd rather be broke
Whatcha gonna do when you're out of favors?
Are you gonna chase this paper?
Whatcha gonna do when the good Lord age ya?
Are you gonna chase this paper?
Cause all I've ever been told
Mo' money, mo' problems
So I'd rather be broke
Stevie ready for 'em!
Mo' money, mo' problems
So I'd rather be broke
Mo' money, mo'-mo' money
Mo' money, mo' problems, baby
Mo' money, mo'-mo' money
Mo' money, mo' problem
Mo' money, mo' problems
So I'd rather be broke
(Static)
  It's funny how we met on the telephone
You and I on the edge of the unknown
Oh, in only a moment's time
I knew my heart was yours and yours was mine
When I saw you waiting at your place
Something felt familiar in your face
Oh, you smiled as if to say
I knew my heart was yours from the first day
We were right
We stood through it all
Holding tight
Whenever we fall
What we found is second to none
I knew, I knew, I knew this would be love
I knew, I knew, I knew this would be love
There were days when I thought I'd lost you
I read the letter aloud, what could I do?
Now, we're right back where we belong
Don't second guess your heart, it's never wrong
I knew, I knew, I knew this would be love
I knew, I knew, I knew this would be love

  Heart beats fast
Colors and prom-misses
How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
  jag skulle vakna mitt i natten
och gå upp och ta en långpromenad
jag skulle låta blicken möta andra ögon
i en främmande stad
jag skulle inte ha så bråttom
med att träffa nån ny
jag har rätt mycket med mig själv
precis som du
jag skulle andas i det tomrum som blev över
om du lämnade mig nu
jag skulle sitta på ett tåg mot Paris
och låta Stockholm va
jag skulle få den tiden över för mig själv
som jag sagt att jag vill ha
jag skulle unna mig att drömma
hundra mil genom Europa
om en främling
lika tillitsfull som du
jag skulle pröva mina läppar mot nån annan
om du lämnade mig nu
jag skulle kunna leva utan den där blicken
som får mig ur balans
jag skulle sakna den där stunden som vi har
när vi till slut har blivit'sams
jag kanske skulle söka upp
kontakter som jag tappat
som jag varit med
förut nånstans
jag antar det finns nån du skulle ringa
om jag inte fanns
jag kanske skulle leta upp nån yngre
som en fjäder i hatten
det skulle bli för tomt om ingen fanns där
som värmde mig i natten
men jag skulle aldrig ha tålamod nog
att bli förstådd
ingen känner mig
så väl som du
jag skulle fastna i min ensamhet igen
om du lämnade mig nu
  Aku bukan yang dulu
Yang terlalu mencuba
Kata apa kau mahu
Kita semua berbeza
Don't need to worry bout the things they say
You've got the power to stand up today
Yang kau perlukan dalam kehidupan hanyalah kekuatan

Take a look inside we the beast and a hustler,

Take a look inside x2
  We were both young
When I first saw you I closed my eyes
And a flashback starts I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way
Through the crowd and say "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me, somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, Baby just say "Yes"
So I sneak out, to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this down for a little while
Uh-Oh, 'cause you were Romeo I was a Scarlet
Letter and my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me, somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, Baby just say "Yes"
Romeo save me they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid we'll, make it out of this mess
It's a love story, Baby just say "Yes"
Uh-Oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting, for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelts to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
It's a love story Baby just say, "Yes"
Uh-Oh-Oh, Uh-Oh-Oh
'Cause we were both young, when I first saw you
  How did we get in so much trouble?
Getting out just seems impossible
Oppression is persisting
I can't fight this brain conditioning
Our Freedom's just a loan
Run by machines and drones
They've got us locked into their sights
Soon they'll control what's left inside
Don't try to hide it,
Don't tell me it's not there
You've got strength
You've got soul
You've felt pain
You've felt love
You can grow(you can grow), You can grow(you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can Revolt
You can Revolt
You can Revolt
Can you hear a distant thunder
Taste Earth's blood and hunger
We live in a toxic jungle
Truth is suppressed to mumbles
They'll take away our homes
They're just machines and drones
Don't try to fight it,
Dont tell me you can't see
That you've got strength
You've got soul
You've felt pain
You've felt love
You can grow(you can grow), You can grow(you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can Revolt
You can Revolt
You can Revolt
I can feel your pain
I can feel your confusion
I can see you're trapped in a maze
Let's find a way to escape
You've got strength
You've got soul
You're not afraid
You're not a drone
You can grow(you can grow), You can grow(you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can Revolt
You can Revolt
You can Revolt
  Through waters uncharted my soul will embark
I'll follow Your voice straight into the dark
And if from the course You intend
I depart
Speak to the sails of my wandering heart
Like the wind
You'll guide
Clear the skies before me
And I'll glide this open sea
Like the stars
Your Word
Will align my voyage
And remind me where I've been
And where I am going
Lost in the shallows amidst fear and fog
Your truth is the compass that points me back north
Jesus
My Captain
My soul's trusted Lord
All my allegiance is rightfully Yours
  Yöllä taas mä menin parvekkeelle nukkumaan,
jotta lähempänä mua ois hän
Pediltäni taivas näkyy, ryhdyin oottamaan,
että näen tähden lentävän
Sanovat jos jossain huomaa tähdenlennon niin
toivoa voit'silloin mitä vaan
Yöllä ylös taivaalle mä pyynnön kuiskasin
Kävisipä pian tuulemaan
Tuuli tuule sinne missä muruseni on
Leiki hetki hänen hiuksillaan
Kerro rakkauteni, kerro kuinka ikävöin
Kerro, häntä ootan yhä vaan
Tyyni oli eilen yö
mut kohta kuitenkin
Tuuli henkäisi ja tuntee sain
Joku liikkui lähelläni
koski poskeain
Tutun käden tunsin ihollain
Enkä enää epäillyt
vaan tiesin, että voin
Niin kuin pieni lapsi nukahtaa
Ilma jota hengitämme samaa ilmaa on
Ja jalkojemme alla sama maa
Tuuli tuule sinne missä muruseni on
Leiki hetki hänen hiuksillaan
Kerro rakkauteni, kerro kuinka ikävöin
Kerro, häntä ootan yhä vaan
Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder?
(Major Lazer)
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We can stay out of the trouble, is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give, the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waitin' for this
On the rocks upon the mountain tops
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
You're always on my mind, oh, there'll come a day
Day where we can fly, reach the glory haze, oh, hey
High up in the sun in the brightest sky
Sun in the brightest sky
  Remember those walls I built?
Well Baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo-halo-halo
I can see your halo-halo-halo
I can feel your halo-halo-halo
I can see your halo-halo-halo, Ooh
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo-halo-halo
I can see your halo-halo-halo
I can feel your halo-halo-halo
I can see your halo-halo-halo
I can feel your halo-halo-halo
I can see your halo-halo-halo
I can feel your halo-halo-halo
I can see your halo-halo-halo, Ooh
halo, Ooh-Ooh
halo, Ooh-Ooh, Ooh-Ooh
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh, Ooh, Ooh
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo-halo-halo
I can see your halo-halo-halo
I can feel your halo-halo-halo
I can see your halo-halo-halo
I can feel your halo-halo-halo
I can see your halo-halo-halo
I can feel your halo-halo-halo
I can see your halo-halo-halo, Ooh
With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going, but
You think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror dont blow it
Look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself
I'm looking at the
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we, here, talking to each other again
Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when Im looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see you, Wayne
I'm looking at the
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we, here, talking to each other again
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my momma's smile, that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message could have been any clearer
So, I'm starting with the man in the
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we talking to each other again
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we, here, talkin' to each other again
So why are we talking to each other again?
  I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me till I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The stench, the stench, of summer sex
And CK eternity, oh hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-venom in me
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me till I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
It's worth two lions, but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me till I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
Get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous
Ask me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Ask how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often
Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the G-Class Grain, matted
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter
That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder
She's just happy that the crew's back in town
She's 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder
Oooh, the sun's risin' up
The night's almost up
The night's almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again
Girl, I'll go again
Girl, I'll go again
  Go now,
Don't look back we've drawn the line,
move on,
Its no good to go back in time,
I'll never find another girl like you,
for happy endings it takes two,
Sarah, Sarah
storms are brewing in your eyes,
Sarah, Sarah
no time is a good time for goodbyes
Danger,
in the game when the stakes are high,
branded,
my heart was branded while my senses stood by,
I'll never find another girl like you,
for happy endings it takes two,
Sarah, Sarah
storms are brewing in your eyes
Sarah, Sarah
no time is a good time for goodbyes
Hey, Sarah,
Love me like no one has ever loved me before,

Sarah, Sarah
storms are brewing in your eyes
Sarah, Sarah

  I know you want me

So put it on me
Let's remove the space between me and you
Now rock your body
Damn I like the way that you move
So give it to me
Cause I already know what you wanna do

  And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from,
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from,
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from,
the dream we have, the love we share, this is what we we're waiting for,
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from,
  "For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless
conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its
sphere of influence: on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion
instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas
vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly-knit,
highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence,

Oh, you can't tell me it's not worth trying for
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more

You know it's true
Everything I do, ohhh, I do it for you
Everything I do darling
We will see it through
We will see it through, yeah
Yeah, just look into your heart
You can't tell me you'll die for love
Oh yeah, I'll be there
I'm goin' all the way, all the way
  Pensando en ti
ninguna herida sana sin cicatriz
así se derrumbó este amor
como cientos de dominoes en filas
cuando algun dedo el primero derriba
como una casa hecha con cartas hasta que una tormenta
sopla su puerta de forma agresiva
como empujar a un niño de un año y medio de vida
sin una maldita razón
como un paracaidista que olvido al paracaídas
así se derrumbo este amor
y ni siquiera por que algunos de los dos quería
si no por no tener un buen detector de mentiras
por si de esa manera en mi memoria vieras
la causa del problema y tambien la solución
quizá me comprendieras a menos que creyeras
que no tengo defectos o soy el nuevo Dios
De nada sirve recordarte los besos de ojos cerrados
Los abrazos y sonrisas del pasado
Los sueños trazados
las veces que hemos llorado
por cosas que han pasado y hemos superado
los juegos, los secretos, los momentos contentos
los sobrenombres tiernos
que serían cursis de no ser por esto que sentimos
que nos mantuvo siempre unidos
y en sus tiempos libres hace que el mundo tenga sentido
Estoy tan confundido, no se si llorar
molestarme, o sentarme a pensar,
buscarte o solamente esperar
Sigo dudando que en algo sirva rezar
y he llegado a pensar que o Dios no existe
o Dios es bipolar
y aquí estaré con tus fotos en mi meoria
quizá con una nueva novia pensando en ti
El tiempo sana heridas de manera obvia
aunque ninguna herida sana sin dejar cicatriz
quisiera tanto tener la voz de un cantante
para no solo recitar sino cantarte
pues mi única defensa es explicar este mal entendido
dame otra oportunidad y querrás envejecer conmigo
esto es como caminar en circulos por horas
como ver un gato perseguir su propia cola
es algo ilógico, estar con otra persona
y preguntarnos como hubiese sido
si te hubieses permitido amarnos
Las calles que transito
los lugares que visito
la ropa que visto, insisto
todo me hacer verte aquí
ayer creí que te vi, y al notar que no eras
supe que aunque pueda no quiero vivir sin ti
no te diré que moriré sin ti porque no creo no creo no creo
tu sabes que soy un guerrero
no te diré que no puedo vivir sin ti porque si puedo si puedo si peudo
sencillamente es que no quiero
y aquí estaré esperándote dandome mi puesto
ojalá que cuando rectifiques yo aún esté dispuesto
a olvidar el pasado
y a perdonarte que no me hayas perdonado
y que no hayas notado que te amo
cuánto te amo
diviértete, vuela muy lejos
que si llegamos a viejos y nos vemos
te diré te odio después de aspirar tu pelo
y si morimos y hay un cielo
me escaparé del infierno
y te haré el amor en una nube en honor a nuestros recuerdos
mira lo cursi que me has convertido
si esto no es amor entonces soy un loco sin motivo
quiero seguir vivo para un día decirte en tu cara que te amo
que aún todo puede ser diferente
si nos juntamos y cambiamos este tema
por uno que diga vivieron felices para siempre
vivieron felices para siempre
  Det finns en sång som säger allt
som värmer när det blåser kallt
som lockar dej att gråta eller jubla
den har nånting som griper tag
och leder dig från natt till dag
och plötsligt vill du sjunga hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Den visar att vi hör ihop
som ett försiktigt glädjerop
förenar det oss i det bitterljuva
det liv vi måste klara av
och allt vi tog och allt vi gav
så vi kan våga ropa hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Det är en sång om enkelhet
det lilla som vi alla vet
den talar till det vackra och det fula
den badar oss i månens sken
så skälvande men ändå ren
ett sprucket men ett vackert hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Och alla drömmar vi har drömt
det vackra som vi nästan glömt
finns kvar och vi kan inte längre ljuga
du ropar och man hör din röst
du har ett ord som ger dig tröst
ett naket och ett enkelt hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah x3
Va', ti posa sui clivi, sui coll,
ove olezzano tepide e molli
l'aure dolci del suolo natal!
Del Giordano le rive saluta,
O mia Patria, sì bella e perduta!
O membranza sì cara e fatal!
Arpa d'or dei fatidici vati,
perché muta dal salice pendi?
Le memorie del petto riaccendi,
ci favella del tempo che fu!
O simile di Solima ai fati,
traggi un suono di crudo lamento;
o t'ispiri il Signore un concento
che ne infonda al patire virtù
che ne infonda al patire virtù
al patire virtù!
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, We gettin paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am,
Only God can judge me, now I'm
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it
And the same ones that I ride with,
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with,
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, thats a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with
(and no way around it)
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin for my dogs, do this everyday,
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin sure we ball,
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa
(I ride or die for love)
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin like a killer inside
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin off set
I look better on your girl than her outfit
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars dont even lose control
  You got that smile
That only Heaven can make
I pray to God every day
That you keep that smile, Yeah
You are my dream (You are my dream)
There's not a thing I won't do
I'll give my life up for you
'Cause you are my dream
And, Baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely, Girl
'Cause you are, the only thing that I got right now
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
'Cause I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you
If you had my child (Little Lady)
You would make my life complete (Little Lady)
Just to have your eyes on little me
That'd be mine forever
And, baby, everything that I have is yours (Ooh, everything)
You will never go cold or hungry I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely, Girl
'Cause you are, the only thing that I got right now
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you, Oh
Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you
We're made, for one another me and you
(And you, and you, and you) And I have no fear
I know we'll make it through, Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Ooh, Ooh-Ooh
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Whoa-Whoa, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
One day when the sky is falling (When the sky is falling)
(Falling, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh) I'll be standing right next to you
(Right next to you, Oh) Right next to you (Right next to you, Oh)
Nothing will ever come between us (Nothing will ever come)

(Oh-Na-Na) Oh Yeah (Oh-Na-Na)
Stand by my side, side, side (Oh-Na-Na, Oh-Na-Na, Whoa)
When the sky falls down (Oh-Na-Na, Oh-Na-Na)
I'll be there (Oh-Na-Na), I'll be there (Oh-Na-Na)
You got that smile
That only Heaven can make
I pray to God every day, to keep you forever
Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
  Why do you build me up (build me up) Buttercup, baby
Just to let me down (let me down)and mess me around
And then worst of all (worst of all) you never call, baby

I need you (I need you) more than anyone, darlin'
You know that I have from the start
So build me up (build me up) Buttercup, don't break my heart
"I'll be over at ten", you told me time and again
But you're late, I wait around and then (bah-dah-dah)
I ran to the door, I can't take any more
is not you, you let me down again
(Hey, hey, hey!) Baby, baby, try to find
(Hey, hey, hey!) A little time, and I'll make you mine
(Hey, hey, hey!) I'll be home
I'll be beside the phone, waiting for you
Oooo-Oooo, oooo-oooo

You know that I have from the start
So build me up (build me up) Buttercup, don't break my heart
To you I'm a toy but I could be the boy you adore
If you'd just let me know (bah-dah-dah)
Although you're untrue, I'm attracted to you all the more
Why do I need you so
(Hey, hey, hey!) Baby, baby, try to find
(Hey, hey, hey!) A little time and I'll make you happy
(Hey, hey, hey!) I'll be home
I'll be beside the phone, waiting for you

Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
Biggie-
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newport's cause I'm due in court
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
( you betta have your gat in hand cause man )
Akon-
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
2pac-
Our lifestyles be close captioned
addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture or the
repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious
Akon-
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
Gun shots every night in the (ghetto)
Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)
Every day is a fight in the (ghetto)
(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)
Got kids to feed in the (ghetto)
Selling coke and weed in the (ghetto)
Every day somebody bleed in the (ghetto)
(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)
Biggie-
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
with my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next?
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead
Akon-
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
Cause thats the life when your
Living in the (ghetto) oh
Eating in the (ghetto) or
Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto)
Thats the life when ur
Living in the (ghetto)oh

never wish death on nobody cuz there aint no comin bac
  Det går en vind över vindens ängar,
Och jag ska skriva en sommarvisa
Jag ville sjunga om Katarina,
till träklangsflöjter och alcymbal
men vindens toner blir sommarns sånger,
Det går en vind över vindens ängar,
Och jag ska skriva en sommarvisa
Det går en flicka i aspelunden,
Med åren blev hon en dröm, en saga,
Jag ville skriva en liten visa,
Men ord blir stumma och toner döva,
Jag vill ju bara sjunga
Jag vill ju bara sjunga
Det går en vind över vindens ängar,
Och jag ska skriva en sommarvisa
Det går en flicka i aspelunden,
Med åren blev hon en dröm, en saga,
Jag ville sjunga om Katarina,
Men ord blir stumma och toner döva,
Jag ville sjunga
Jag vill ju bara sjunga,
om Katarina,
Jag stod under ditt sommarfönster
  People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road
(Stay) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay) Hey
Now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was stay
Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I been picking off the pieces
Off the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye
(Stay) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay) Hey
Now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay, stay, stay, stay, stay)
Let me remind you
This was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this, not like this
(Stay) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay) Hey
Now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was stay
  I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said "Don't leave me here alone"
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
gone
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
(INSTRUMENTAL)
Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Cecille will pick out all your clothes
I think I'm gonna like it here!
The swimming pool is to the left
The tennis court is in the rear
Have an instructor here at noon
When you wake Ring for Drake
Drake will bring your tray
No need to pick up any toys
No finger will you lift my dear
We have but one request
Please put us to the test
I know I'm gonna like it here
Used to room in a tomb
Where i'd sit and freeze
Get me now, holy cow
We've never had a little girl
We hope you understand Your wish is our command
I know I'm gonna like it here
We know you're gonna like It here
Welcome
  Died last night in my dreams
Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there was no answer
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected
Now, I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight, Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
There's no one left in the world
I'm gunslingin'
Don't give a damn if I go
Down, down, down
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing
Oh, my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Oh, my heart is a ghost town
(Said, my heart)
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
  I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya like a black widow, Baby
It's just a cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play it and somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, like in a lovely
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I want it all or nothing for us ain't no place in between
Made me believe in what you say that you never mean
Like it will last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got a mirror
And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
You used to be, thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So Baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what)
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya, like a black widow, Baby
Black-Black Widow, Baby
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you I'm doing whatever works
You've never met nobody, that'll do you how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees, praise Jesus hallelujah
I'mma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Till you feel like you breathe for it
'Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air and you lean for it
'Till they have a CAT scan and check on your mind and it's nothing but me
On it (On it, on it), now it's me-time believe that
If it's yours when you want it I wouldn't promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at I can't fall back go quick
'Cause this here a fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shit
You used to be, thirsty for me (Right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So Baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what)
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya, like a black widow, Baby
Black-Black-Black-Black Widow, Baby
  Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on a tree
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all having fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when they die
That's what I mean
And this whole world is a new world
And a whole world
For me
Stars, when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life
For me
Yes, it's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
And I'm feeling good

  För man vill ha vad man vill ha å man man vill ha det nu
Och om man ser en möjlighet att få så kvittar det hur
För vi är vildare än djur när det gäller å ta
Och står någon i min väg, ja då smäller det bra
ingenting e heligt för nu roffar vi åt
å kan man tjäna på ett tåg, ja då hoppar vi på
Jag menar, varför kompromissa, varför vika en tum?
För någon annan gjorde det - ska jag vara lika dum?
Jag menar jag vill ha det bra som de rika har
om dom är hänsynslösa är jag likadan
men vad dom inte vet e att jag inte har nåt å förlora
Så betänkligheterna för mig kan aldrig vara stora
Ref
Alla vill till himmelen men få vill ju dö
Man vill kamma in vinningen, men sår inga frön
Man vill ha sin bit av kakan & man vill äta den me
Folk vill ta tillbaka, men vägrar att ge
Och jag ska göra vad jag gör, och jag ska göra det gott
Och fortsätta till nån kommer och berövar min lott
För vem bestämmer rätt och fel när moralen är död
Och folk mördar ju varandra för sitt dagliga bröd
Staten backar bakåt, företagen tar över
Och dom pratar en massa prat men ger oss dåliga löner
Så mycket skit att man kan tro miljoner magar tömts
Så dom tvingar oss simma runt i ett hav av lögner
Sanningen är numera ett minne blott
Varje sak vi lägger till så försvinner nåt
Ja, detta mina damer och herrar är vad vi är
Men jag hör gubbarna på TV säga dom vill ha fred
Ref
Och jag ska, spotta epistlar som det
Var min sista dag och jag visste om det
Jag kanske hittar svaren i sista ronden
Har missat så många val att det visslar om det
Listan är lång den som vägen dit och dylikt
Kosta vad det vill, till säkerligen ett dyrt pris
Har tänkt på det, men mestadels ytligt
Fel djupdyk det testar en psykiskt
Man får betala för allt som betyder nåt
Sån är lagen, inget alls vi kan fly ifrån
Jag ser det jag ser och ser inget annat
Och det jag ser när jag tittar gör mig redigt förbannad
Vi är på väg någonstans och jag vet inte vart
Hoppas vi kan komma på det medan planeten är kvar
Prylar, grejer, saker är det något att ha?
Men är det sår i hjärtat på dom som plågar oss bra
Jag menar riskerna är många, men dom måste vi ta
För lidandet blir ännu större utan nåt kapital
Konsekvenserna spelar mig ingen roll
den enda hjälp som jag kan få kommer ju inifrån
Och man kan fråga vem man vill, även de vänliga
Men ingen här har råd att assistera främlingar
Så det hela resulterar i en nedåtspiral
Så vi kör en mano a mano tills den ene är kvar
Ref
  We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world
Now darling, sit down, let go
Can I call you, you're mine
So can I call you, you're mine now darling for a whole lot of time
My heart finally trust my mind
And I know somehow it's right
In all we got time
Yeah
So darling just swear you'll stay right by my side
In all we got love
Yeah
So darling just swear you'll stand right by my side
We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world
Now darling, sit down, let go
I've got something to say
You're perfect in every way
I'm gonna shout it out
I wanna tell you now
'Cause I know somehow it's right
In all we got time
Yeah
Darling just swear you'll stay right by my side
In all we got love
Yeah
So darling just swear you'll stand right by my side
Be my forever
Be my forever
Be my forever
Be my forever
Be my forever
Be my forever
You're my bright blue sky
You're the sun in my eyes
Baby you're my life
We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world
Now darling, sit down, let go
In all we got time
Yeah
We got love
So darling just swear you'll stay right by my side
In all we got love
Yeah
So darling just swear you'll stand right by my side
Be my forever
Be my forever
Be my forever
Be my forever
Be my forever
Be my forever
Will you love me forever?
I'll love you forever
Be my forever
Be my forever
Be my forever
Be my forever
  There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
  Oh, you've got the feeling that I wanna feel
Oh, you've got the feeling that I know is real, real, real
It's in the way you look, it's in the way you love
And I can see that this is real
It's in the way you talk, it's in the way you touch
And I can see
This is real, real, real, real love
This is real, real, real, real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
Oh, before you I was searching for a rarity
Oh, you showed me things I'd never thought that I would see
It's in the way you look, it's in the way you love
And I can see that this is real
It's in the way you talk, it's in the way you touch
And I can see
This is real, real, real, real love
This is real, real, real, real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
Time won't waste, and we just learn
To take it slow and wait our turn
Held my breath, cause I believed
That you'll find me
Real, real, real, real love
This is real, real, real, real love
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love
This is real, real, real, real love
This is real, real, real, real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love, real love
  I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
I was trying to take your heart
Keep it in a cardboard box
So when it gets hard
You'll never be far
And your love won't be lost
As the bridges fall apart
I still find a way to cross
And even if you are lost among the stars
Your love won't go off
For me me me me it's in this
But I need need need more of this
Can't turn away, feel it push me
And I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I can feel you take my love
And tangle it above the ground
And if the strings are cut
Nothing holds me up
Nothing takes me down
For me me me me it's in this
But I need need need more of this
Can't turn away, feel it push me
And I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
When I try to fall for from your candlelight
I get lost in your maybe maybe
I'm just falling
When I try to hide from your love I can't deny with maybe maybe
It's just my calling
But and I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
  I'm forever blowing bubbles,
pretty bubbles in the air,
they fly so high, nearly reach the sky
Fortunes always hiding,
I've looked everywhere,
I'm forever blowing bubbles,
pretty bubbles in the air!
United "clap clap clap"
United "clap clap clap"
United "clap clap clap"
Let's go fucking mental
Let's go fucking mental

Let's go fucking mental
Let's go fucking mental

The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
To find a queen without a king,
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
  Era só Jajão
Quando tu dizias que eu sou teu único amor baby
Era só Jajão
Quando tu dizias que serias sempre a minha baby
Era só Jajão
Tu dizias que me morres que me adoras baby
Era só Jajão
Quando tu dizias para pedir a tua mão
E o que faço eu se não tenho o teu carinho
E o que faço eu se não tenho o teu beijinho
E o que faço eu se não tenho a onde eu te encontrar
E o que faço eu se não tenho a onde reclamar
Me diz porquê pelo amor de deus
Sabes que eu amava-te de coração
Eu não mereço, eu não mereço!
Foi muito pior que bala de canhão
De princesa para rainha do Jajão
Eu não mereço, eu não mereço!
Juro eu não mereço baby
Eu juro, eu não entendo baby
Parece coisa do outro mundo sweet
E se for vodu, quebra esse feitiço
Eu quero a minha bo
(porque eu amo)
Amo demais essa mulher
(amo)
Me diz que posso fazer
E o que faço eu se não tenho o teu carinho
E o que faço eu se não tenho o teu beijinho
E o que faço eu se não tenho a onde eu te encontrar
E o que faço eu, diz-me onde reclamar
Me diz porquê pelo amor de deus
Sabes que eu amava-te de coração
Eu não mereço, eu não mereço!
Foi muito pior que bala de canhão
De princesa para rainha do Jajão
Eu não mereço, eu não mereço!
Me diz porquê pelo amor de deus
Sabes que eu amava-te de coração
Eu não mereço, eu não mereço!
Foi muito pior que bala de canhão
De princesa para rainha do Jajão
Eu não mereço, eu não mereço!
Juro eu não mereço!
Me diz porquê pelo amor de deus
Sabes que eu amava-te de coração
Eu não mereço, eu não mereço!
Foi muito pior que bala de canhão
De princesa para rainha do Jajão
Eu não mereço, eu não mereço!
Me diz porquê pelo amor de deus
Sabes que eu amava-te de coração
Eu não mereço, eu não mereço!
Foi muito pior que bala de canhão
De princesa para rainha do Jajão
Eu não mereço, eu não mereço!

  Take this fainted heart
Take these tainted hands
Wash me in your love
Come like grace again
Even when my strength is lost
I'll praise You
Even when I have no song
I'll praise You
Even when its hard to find the words louder than I'll sing Your praise
I will only sing Your praise
Take this mountain weight
Take these ocean tears
Hold me through the trials
Come like hope again
Even when the fight seems lost
I'll praise You
Even when it hurts like hell
I'll praise You
Even when it makes no sense to sing louder than I'll sing Your praise
I will only sing Your praise
I will only sing Your praise
I will only sing Your praise
I will only sing Your praise
And my heart burns only for You
You are all You are all I want
And my soul waits only for You
And I will sing till the morning has come
Lord my heart burns only for You
You are all You are all I want
And my soul waits only for You
And I will sing till the miracle comes
I will only sing Your praise
I will only sing Your praise
I will only sing Your praise
Even when the morning comes
I'll praise You
Even when the fight is won
I'll praise You
Even when my time on earth is done
Louder then I'll sing Your praise
I will only sing Your praise
  I will sing forever of Your love, O Lord
I will celebrate the wonder of Your name
For the word that You speak is a song of forgiveness
And a song of gentle mercy and of peace
Let us wake at the morning and be filled with Your love
And sing songs of praise all our days
For Your love is as high as the heavens above us
And Your faithfulness as certain as the dawn
I will sing forever of Your love, O Lord
I will celebrate the wonder of Your name
For the word that You speak is a song of forgiveness
And a song of gentle mercy and of peace
I will sing forever of Your love, O Lord
For You are my refuge and my strength
You fill the world with Your life-giving spirit
That speaks Your word
Your word of mercy and of peace
CODA:
And I will sing forever of Your love, O Lord
Yes I will sing forever of Your love, O Lord
  Draw me close to you
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear you say that I'm your friend
You are my desire
No one else will do
Cause nothing else can take your place
To feel the warmth of your embrace
Help me find the way
Bring me back to you
You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know you are near
I love you baby, and if it's quite all right,
Trust in me when I say:
  Dom är uppe på taken
alla är högt över staden
Sommarn snurrar fort
när vi bara snöar bort
Och jag vågade aldrig hålla din hand
Vi är inte såna som i slutet får varann
Och alla bara pratar
"är det sant" och "jag har hört om dig"
Jag kommer aldrig tillbaka hit igen
Neonskyltar på gatorna
sänder ljus till mig och skatorna
Alla dansar, och jag tänker
är du också själv?
Vem kysste Elin
bakom ryggen på Marie
Var det den store poeten
som hon var förälskad i?
Fanns det en plats
i hennes värld för två?
Snälla skicka ett vykort
för jag undrar så
Och jag undrar vad som händer
i vår del av stan
Vinden håller tal vid en hamburgebar
Den har blåst sig trött
och alla flickor har gått hem
Och du va sötare än dom
men jag slängde bort dig igen
jag slängde bort nån slags vän
Det va så mörkt
den kvällen jag gick hem
jag hade hoppats på något, hoppats på någooot
(hoppats på något, A-ha)
Om du vill ha mig,
nu kan du få mig så lätt
Om du vill ha mig,
nu kan du få mig så lätt
Om du vill ha mig,
nu kan du få mig så lätt
Om du vill ha mig,
nu kan du få-å-hå mig
Lura mig
nej,nej
vad folk än säger
Its not the ecstasy, its not what you see in that scene
Love is thinking about others before you think about yourself
Love is when you lay down your life for another
Whether for your brother, your mother, your father or your sister
Its even laying down your life for your enemies,
That's unthinkable, but think about that
Love is true
I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love
It does not envy, it does not boast
It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, it always perseveres
Its eternal, it goes on and on, it goes beyond time
Love is the only thing that will last when you die
But ask the question why? Do you have love?
I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love
There is no greater love than this than he
who lays down his life for his friends
Now are you willing to lay down your life for your friends?
You're probably willing to lay down your life for your mother
your father, or your best friends
But are you willing to lay down your life for even those that hate you?
I'm going to tell you who did that
The nails in his hands, the thorns in his brow
Hanging on a cross for your sin my sins
That is love he died for you and me while we still hated him
That is love
God is true love, and if you don't know this love
Now is the time to know, perfect love
I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love
(repeat)
Cause everywhere I've been walking ,
If I don't get some resurrection soon
I'm going down to the river to wash my soul again
  Maybe far away
Or maybe real nerby
He may be pouring her coffe
She may be straighting his tie!
Maybe in a house
All hidden by a hill
She's sitting playing piano,
He's sitting paying a bill!
Betcha they're young
Betcha they're smart
Bet they collect things
Like ashtrays, and art!
Betcha they're good
(Why shouldn't they be?)
Their one mistake
Was giving up me!
So maybe now it's time,
and maybe when I wake
They'll be there calling me "Baby"
Betcha he reads
Betcha she sews
Maybe she's made me a closet of clothes!
Maybe they're strict
As straight as a line
Don't really care
As long as they're mine!
So maybe now this prayer's
Won't you please come get your "Baby"
Maybe
  I am nothing without love
I'm but a ship stuck in the sand
Some would say that I'm all alone
But I am, I'm nothing without love
I wanna hold her in my arms
She feelin' alone, she feelin' sad
I would take credit for what's wrong,
But I am, I'm nothing without love
Three years at sea after the storm
And this sinking ship-love you put me on
God, I wish a gust of wind would come
And carry me home
But I, I got nowhere to go
Now I hear you sharp with the force of a wave
So I said myself I'm headed for the unpast day
Hey hey, I don't wanna lose this one
She made me feel whole, you know
I am, I'm nothing without love
Oh baby, show me a sign
Send me a signal that everything's fine
Come on, stand up right up by my side
You know that I wanna rest in your life
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
I wanna rest in your life
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
I am nothing without love
I'm just these palms without a pair
And I would take credit for this all
But I, I am nothing without love
Oh baby, show me a sign
Send me a signal that everything's fine
Come on, come one, come on right by my side
Don't you know that I, don't you know that I
Don't you know that I, I wanna rest in your life
I wanna rest in your life
I wanna rest in your life
I wanna rest in your life
'Cause I, I am nothing without love
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
  On Raglan Road of an autumn day
I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare
That I might one day rue
I saw the danger and I passed
Along the enchanted way
And I said let grief be a fallen leaf
At the dawning of the day
On Grafton Street in November
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worth of passion's pledge
The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
And I not making hay
Oh I loved too much and by such by such
Is happiness thrown away
I gave her gifts of the mind
I gave her the secret signs
That's known to the artists who have known
The true gods of sound and stone
And word and tint I did not stint
I gave her poems to say
With her own name there
And her own dark hair
Like clouds over fields of May
On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
I see her walking now
Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow
That I had loved not as I should
A creature made of clay
When the angel woos the clay
He'll lose his wings at the dawn of day
  This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall)
Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall
  Hush, don't speak
When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire
I can't find those silver linings
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough
I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it
I go
I find a way to block it
I go
Yes our love is running out of time
I won't count the hours, rather be a coward
When our words collide
I'm gonna drown you out before I lose my mind
I can't find those silver linings
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough
I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it
I go
I find a way to block it
I go
I find a way to block you, oh
I find a way to block it
I go
I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it
I go
I'm covering my ears like a kid
when your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it
I go
  Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines

We've been training for years
Now we're ready to strike
As the great operation begins
We're the first wave on shore
We're the first ones to fall
Yet soldiers has fallen before
In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History's written today
In this burning inferno
Until nothing remains
As our forces advance on the beach
Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory's ours their forces will fall
Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo Victoria
On the 6:th of June
On the shores of western Europe
1944
D-day upon us
We've been here before
Used to this kind of war
Crossfire grind through the sand
Our orders were easy
It's kill or be killed
Blood on both sides will be spilled
In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History's written today
Now that we are at war with the Axis again
This time we know what will come
Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory's ours their forces will fall
Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines

On the 6:th of June
On the shores of western Europe

D-day upon us
6:th of June 1944
Allies are turning the war
Normandy state of anarchy

Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory's ours their forces will fall
Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven

You know, from the moment she turn around
She know, how to back it up and drop it down
She know, she what all the fellas looking at
Cause they know, soon as her song come on it's a wrap
And she loves the attention
That she get when she moves, yeah
Showin' out with her home girls
Hypnotizing all the dudes, oh
And she knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
I know, I know, she knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
And I know, I know, she knows
She bad, mix of ratchet with the classy, oh
So bad, I just couldn't let her pass me, no
I told her, "Shawty, you so right, but you so wrong"
(So wrong, so wrong, so wrong)
She said, "Daddy, I'll be back after this song"
"Then you takin' me home"
Said I know
Said I know she loves the attention
That she get when she moves
Showin' out with her home girls
And she got me watching too girl
She know what she working with
(She know, she know, she know)
I see you, uh
You got my attention baby, go do what you do
I think she noticed, know you gon' have to make a move
All this ice in my rolley, no wonder I play it cool
Eyes on you, I watch it bounce
When she walk, she lick her lips
When she talk
I throw her in that Bentley coupé with the top off like Mardi Gras
All that cake, come get you some filling
Like a soap opera come watch all my children
Hit it so long that she might lose feeling
With her legs in the air, she gon' walk on the ceiling
  Yo left, yo left
Yo left, right, left
Yo left,,
Gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit outta you
And get that motivation, to not give up
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face
Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps
Till the day that I drop
'Cause when I'm not, then I'ma stop pinnin'em
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin'em
Women are caught in webs
Spin'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of peniciline could not get illin' to stop
The criminal cop killin' hip hop villain a minimal swap
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzin' up?
Till the roof comes off
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
And my high burns out
I'ma rip these shit
Till my bones collapse (x2)
There's a certain feeling you get
When you're real, and you spit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
It goes Reggie, Jay Z, Tupac and Biggie
Nate hit me,
Till the roof comes off
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
And my high burns out
I'ma rip these shit
Till my bones collapse (x2)
What is he thinking?
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so,
Till the roof comes off
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
And my high burns out
I'ma rip these shit
Till my bones collapse (x2)
Until the roof, the roof comes off

  Over the hills and far away,
Time for teletubbies,
time for teletubbies,
Say, Heeeeee-lo! "Eh-oh!"
"Where have the teletubbies gone ?
Where have the teletubbies gone?"
  You don't have to worry
And don't you be afraid
Joy comes in the morning
Troubles they don't last always
For there's a friend named Jesus
Who will wipe your tears away
And if your heart is broken
Just lift your hands and say
I know that I can make it
I know that I can stand
No matter what may come my way
My life is in your hands
You don't have to worry
And don't you be afraid
Joy comes in the morning
Troubles they don't last always
For there's a friend named Jesus
Who will wipe your tears away
And if your heart is broken
Just lift your hands and say
I know that I can make it
I know that I can stand
No matter what may come my way
My life is in your hands
With Jesus I can take it
With Him, I know I can stand
No matter what may come my way
My life is in your hands
So when your tests and trials
They seem to get you down
And all your friends and loved ones
Are nowhere to be found
Remember there's a friend named Jesus
Who will wipe your tears away
And if your heart is broken
Just lift your hands and say
I know that I can make it
I know that I can stand
No matter what may come my way
My life is in your hands
With Jesus I can take it
With Him, I know I can stand
No matter what may come my way
My life is in your hands
  You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still you live inside of me
So tell me how is that
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And thought you break my heart
You're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
Cause I can't erase the times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way, no no
I don't wanna broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl no no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl
There's something that I feel I need to say
But up 'til now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving of me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh but now I don't hate you I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way, no no
I don't wanna broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, mmm yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you,
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna broken heart
Don't wanna to take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way, no no
I don't wanna broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
Bless 'em on the rain, no stress

  Hey, MMM-MMM-MMM
You're spinning round and round
And round in my head, head
Did you really mean the words that you said, said?
This is it I gotta know
Should I stay or should I go? Show me the truth
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you? Uh-Huh
I know you gon be mad feelings that you thought you had
Was for another guy, well I'm that other guy
I'm just a shy kid camouflaged before your eyes
Then I knew my lyrics were the key to see the other side
I should have told you but I never had the courage
And I thought you really wouldn't understand, Oh-Oh
And now I'm here just to let my feelings surface
Apologizing for disguising who I am
MMM-MMM, tell me are you who I thought you were?
Or who I wanted you to be?
Did you do it all for him?
Or were you only playing me?
I did it for you
But I couldn't see it through (But I couldn't see it through)
You're spinning round and round
And round in my head, head
Did you really mean the words that you said, said?
This is it I gotta know
Should I stay or should I go? Show me the truth
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you? Yeah
You're all I ever wanted
But I got caught in the shadow in the background
But I'm back now, and Kris was all this and that
And my look didn't really fit the rap it didn't match
He had the style and I had the swag
So I locked up my feelings in the words he said
Give me a hand and I'll take off my mask
If you, give me a chance that's all I ask
What're you expecting me to do?
First you were him and now you're you
Now it's just me
And you got me on my knees (And you got me on my knees)
You're spinning round and round
And round in my head, head
Did you really mean the words that you said, said?
This is it I gotta know
Should I stay or should I go? Show me the truth
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Why do I feel so deceived?
Guess I believed what I wanted to believe it's
Perfect in my dreams
But nothing's really what it seems, no-no
You're spinning round and round
And round in my head, head
Did you really mean the words that you said, said?
(Did you really mean what you said?) This is it I gotta know
Should I stay or should I go? Show me the truth
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
MMM-MMM-MMM-MMM
Yeah-Eh-Eh, gonna be me and you, Oh No

Do it again, and again till you say my name
And by the way

Hold you like a paper plane

  Fått en flaska i huvet, legat sövd på akuten
Varit död i minuter, hela själen var bruten
Blivit jagad av snuten, varit vilsen på djupet
Jag har famlat i mörker, men i dig såg jag ljuset
Och för dig har jag låtsats, och dolt mina tårar
Med dig blir jag mindre, som gubben i lådan
Jag vägrar att inse, du sviker mig alltid
Jag gräver min grav för dig, jag är en soldat för dig
Jag tog en kula för dig, och fick en smula tillbaks
För dig ska jag, göra det tusen gånger om
Jag har givit dig allt, och jag har ingenting kvar
För dig ska jag göra det tusen gånger om
Tusen gånger om
Blivit lämnad i staden, medan du gick och blunda
Fick jag kängor mot magen, tills jag smakade gatan
Ändå gick jag tillbaka, och jag måste va galen
Som nyss blivit bedragen, och som tänkte på laget
För jag trängde bort jag-et, och jag såg alla tecken
Men jag ville va bättre, men då blev allting sämre
Jag vägrar att inse, du sviker mig alltid
Jag gräver min grav för dig, jag är en soldat för dig
Jag tog en kula för dig, och fick en smula tillbaks
För dig ska jag, göra det tusen gånger om
Jag har givit dig allt, och jag har ingenting kvar
För dig ska jag göra det tusen gånger om
Tusen gånger om
Ställ oss båda på en våg, och snart så flyger du bland stjärnor
Jag bär tyngden utav rymden, ändå finns du i mitt hjärta
Ta mitt skimmer, för jag brinner, du är blott en blek lanterna
Jag har gjort det här så länge, jag kan lika väl fortsätta
Jag tog en kula för dig, och fick en smula tillbaks
För dig ska jag, göra det tusen gånger om
Jag har givit dig allt, och jag har ingenting kvar
För dig ska jag göra det tusen gånger om
Jag tog en kula för dig, och fick en smula tillbaks
För dig ska jag, göra det tusen gånger om
Jag har givit dig allt, och jag har ingenting kvar
För dig ska jag göra det tusen gånger om
Jag har givit dig allt, och jag har ingenting kvar
För dig ska jag göra det tusen gånger om

  I never thought that it'd be so simple but
I found a way, I found a way
I always thought that it'd be too crazy but
I found a way, I found a way
if you open up your mind
See what's inside
It's gonna take some time, to realize
always show that you know that i told you
Now that I know that anything's possible
I found a way, I found a way
No one can break what is so unbreakable
I found a way, I found a way
And if you open up your mind
See what's inside
Well it's gonna take some time, to realize
But if you look inside, I'm sure you'll find
Over your shoulder you know that I told you
I'll always be pickin' you up when you're down
So just turn around
One day I'm gonna fly away
One day when heavens calls my name
I lay down I close my eyes at night
I can see morning Light
One day I'm gonna fly away
One day I'll see your eyes again
Dele man hanoozam pishet gire
Nagoo ke dige direh
Joodaei ye rooz az
Bemireh
One day I'm gonna fly away
One day when heavens calls my name
I lay down I close my eyes at night
I can see morning Light
One day I'm gonna fly away
One day I'll see your eyes again
Bitabeh bi to man,
Harja ke basham bazam
Man duset daram!
One day I'm gonna fly away
One day when heavens calls my name
I lay down I close my eyes at night
I can see morning Light
One day I'm gonna fly away
One day I'll see your eyes again
  Just another heartache in waiting
Just another sweet talking dream that ends in lonely nights
Just another handsome breakup
And he'll be gone before the morning light
But he's my mistake to make, all night (night, night, night)
This bar is full of locals, tourists, drunks and we are all hopeful
praying that tonight we will be better than the rest
Most of us think we are movie stars give us a shot the world is ours
Come on baby, I think that you and I should dance
Just another heartache in waiting
Just another sweet talking dream that ends in lonely nights
Just another handsome breakup
And he'll be gone before the morning light
But he's my mistake to make, all night (night, night, night)
Telling us stories about the younger years
We're framed by the names etched in the boothel
Letting my shoulder lean on yours in this cloud of cigarette smoke
I lose track of time on purpose tomorrow's gonna be long
but it's worth it to feel the spins of alcohol and freedom
He'd just might and we'd still could come to debate it if I should
Just another heartache in waiting
Just another sweet talking dream that ends in lonely nights
Just another handsome breakup
And he'll be gone before the morning light
But he's my mistake to make, all night
Ohohohoh
This bar is shutting and I don't mind if you walk me out
Oh that's kinda what life's about
Just another heartache in waiting
Just another sweet talking dream that ends in lonely nights
Just another handsome breakup
And he'll be gone before the morning light
But he's my mistake to make, all night
Ohohohoh
He's my mistake to make all night
  Bananas in pajamas are coming down the stairs,
Bananas in pajamas are coming down in pairs,
Bananas in pajamas are chasing teddy bears,
'cause on Tuesdays they all try to catch them unawares
  There's no need for distance
No need for touch
No need for answers 'cause I've heard enough
I just find a chest some place out of reach
I enter the darkness and lay my release
And open my, open my heart
Sing like a nightingale and open my, open my hands
When no one else understands
I just close my eyes
And count to ten
Breathing twice
And open them
Nowhere to go cause I've been there before
In my mind it is near
I escape all I fear
So by closing my eyes
I am anywhere but here
There's no need for anger
Religion or faith
One glade of grief
Will always remain
It's not on the paper
Or a story book
It's a place to reunite with all that was took
And open my, open my heart
Sing like a nightingale open my, open my hands
When no one else understands
I just close my eyes
And count to ten
Breathing twice
And open them
Nowhere to go cause I've been there before
In my mind it is near
I escape all I fear
So by closing my eyes
I am anywhere but here
Picture a land where you never have been
Where life is eternal and evergreen
The future of happiness and serenity
He loved and you're lost for now in eternity
I close my eyes
And count to ten
Breathing twice
And open them
Nowhere to go cause I've been there before
In my mind it is near
I escape all I fear
So by closing my eyes
I am anywhere but here

Koi Tufanon Se Kah De, Mil Gaya Sahil Mujhe
Pad Gai Dil Par Meri, Aapki Parchhaiyan
Har Taraf Bajane Lagin Saikadon Shahnaaiyaan
Hanske Apni Zindagi Mein, Kar Liya Shaamil Mujhe
  I keep, going to the river to pray
'Cause I need, something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
My friends had you figured out
Yeah they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake (Ooh-Ooh)
I had to go through Hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the Devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah it's still burning
I keep, going to the river to pray
'Cause I need, something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
I keep, going to the river to pray
'Cause I need, something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
'Cause I love living in the sin
Oh you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learned (Ooh-Ooh)
I keep, going to the river to pray
'Cause I need, something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
I keep, going to the river to pray
'Cause I need, something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, stop the haunting, Baby
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, no more haunting, baby
I keep, going to the river
I keep, going to the river to pray
'Cause I need, something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost (Your ghost), the ghost of you it keeps me awake
I keep (I keep), going to the river to pray
'Cause I need, something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
  I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way, to never let it get that far
Because of you
I'll never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side
So I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake, a smile, a laugh
Every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I'll never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side
So I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die
I heard you cry
Every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry
In the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I'll never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side
So I don't get hurt
Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of you
  Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want, yeah
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)
Yeah, yeah, oooooh
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)
  What's wrong with the world, mama
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Badness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Now, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt can you hear them cryin'?
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father help us
Send us some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? (Love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
The love, the love
It just ain't the same, always unchanged
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
So I can ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin'
in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't really know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't really know)
Where's the love, y'all( come on yeah)
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
And would you turn the other cheek
Father, Father, Father help us
Send us some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love)
Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love
The love, the love
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images, it's the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids want to act like what they see in the cinema
Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness in equality
Instead in spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found now ask yourself
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
And would you turn the other cheek
Father, Father, Father help us
Send us some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love)
Sing with me, y'all
(one world one world)
We only got (one world one world)
That's all we got (one world one world)
And somethings wrong with it (yeah)
And somethings wrong with it (yeah)
And somethings wrong with the w-w-world yeah
We only got (one world one world)
That's all we got (one world one world)
  Min resa var mot solen, långt bortom alla slutna rum,
Jag ville se miraklet, och höra ord som föder liv,
Stad i ljus, i ett land utan namn,
Och så när allt förändrats, när tiden inte längre finns,
Så ser jag oss tillsammans, och då är resan slut,
Stad i ljus, i ett land utan namn,
Stad i ljus, i ett land utan namn,
  Um cantinho, um violão
Esse amor, uma canção
Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama
Muita calma pra pensar
E ter tempo pra sonhar
Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor, que lindo!
Quero a vida sempre assim
Com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama
E eu que era triste
Descrente desse mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib and never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz like a young Doc Gooden
Thug shades cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with 5 Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'till the chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue
So many women wanna call me, baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy, igh
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue
La La La La
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo
Dropped a mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hitlist
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, Bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain, all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, what? nothin'
Nuh, superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't (fuckin' wasn't)
Uh, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasing the stardom'll turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
Ok, hello it's the martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car, and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fuckin' rollercoaster then it drops
But what should I scream for? this is my theme park!
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the King talk, check the price and pay attention
Little Wayne, thats what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin on the gas
No break pads, no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian, they go so ballistic whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He aint had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin' into the brains of these hoes
And establishin a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking bout when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villians
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
So how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just incase
You was thinkin of savin face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know
She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know, girl, I know
She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
  well she calls me up when she's broken
says to leave my front door open
i come home to find her smoking
with her eyes all fragile and thin
she's always been hopeless at hoping
always coped badly with coping
and i never know when she's joking
she never lets anyone in
i know i'm a fool to let her run away with my heart
and she'll never tire of these games
loving her is like playing catch in the dark
I'm a tear drop in an ocean of flames
and we'll drink too much for a wednesday
she'll ask me why none of her men stay
i tell her just what her friends say
it never goes down too well
and she'll stay hear til late in the evening
but she's always arriving or leaving
never decides to believe in
the people who know her so well
i know i'm a fool to let her run away with my heart
and she'll never tire of these games
loving her is like playing catch in the dark
I'm a tear drop in an ocean of flames
she says if we're single at 40
we'll get married and move to the country
but i know she'll never want me
then its five fifteen in the morning
i reach for her whilst I'm yawning
she leaves me with no warning

Du är som stjärnorna, som vindarna, som vågorna,
Du är mitt blod och mina lungor, mina ögon, mina skuldror,
Friheten är ditt vackra namn, vänskapen är din stolta moder,
rättvisan är din broder, freden är din syster,
Du är som stjärnorna, som vindarna, som vågorna,
  Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me this way
I thought we agreed, that we both felt the same
Baby, don't hurt me, it's not ok
Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me this way
I thought we agreed, that we both felt the same
Baby, don't hurt me, it's not ok
You say
I know I told you
Girl there's no excuse
We both have to draw the line
You had the chance to choose
Why you messing, messing with my head?
Making me feel guilty
When you know I'm innocent
Baby, please, o-o-oh
You were just a fling
I never would have started
If I knew how it would end
All I'm asking
Is take this pain away
What you give is what you get
I said no, but you're still begging
Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me this way
  Before the world began
You were on His mind
And every tear you cry
Is precious in His eyes
Because of His great love
He gave His only Son
Everything was done
So you would come
Nothing you can do
Could make Him love you more
And nothing that you've done
Could make Him close the door
Because of His great love
He gave His only Son
Everything was done
So you would come
Come to the Father
Though your gift is small
Broken hearts, broken lives
He will take them all
The power of the Word
The power of His blood
Everything was done
So you would come
  (Never x3)
You lift my heart up
When the rest of me is down (never)
You, you enchant me,
even when you are not around (never)
If there are boundaries,
I will try to knock them down (never)
I'm latching on, babe
Now I know what I have found (never)
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in you're love babe?
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching onto you (never)
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching onto you (never)
I'm so encaptured,
got me wrapped up in your touch (never)
Feel so enamored,
hold me tight within your clutch (never)
How do you do it,
you got me losing every breath (never)
What did you give me
to make my heart bleed out my chest (never)
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching onto you (never)
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching onto you
I won't let go of you
I got a lotta cash
I don't mind spending it
Do you like the way I flick my tongue or nah?
You can ride my face until you're drippin' cum
Can you lick the tip then throat the dick or nah?
Can you let me stretch that pussy out or nah?
I'm not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrappin 'round me is a prob
Ain't nobody tryna save ya
Baby, get that paper
Probably got a lot of other bitches owe you favors
Pussy so good, I had to save that shit for later
Took her to the kitchen, fucked her right there on the table
She repping XO to the death, I'm tryna make these bitches sweat
I'm tryna keep that pussy wet, I'm tryna fuck her and her friends
You gonna run it for these hunnids girl or nah?
Show me is you really 'bout your money girl or nah?
Don't play with a boss, girl take it off
Take it for a real one
You gonna get it all
Is you really 'bout your money or nah?
Can you really take dick or nah?
Can I bring another bitch or nah?
Is you with the shits or nah?
Oh nah, oh nah
Would you ride for a nigga or nah?
Would you die for a nigga or nah?
Would you lie to a nigga or nah?
Oh nah
Can you really take dick or nah?
Can I bring another bitch or nah?
Is you with the shits or nah?
Oh nah, oh nah
Would you ride for a nigga or nah?
Would you die for a nigga or nah?
Would you lie to a nigga or nah?
Oh nah
I'ma smoke this joint then I'ma break you off
I be lying if I said you ain't the one
All these tattoos in my skin, they turn you on
Lotta smoking, drinking, that's the shit I'm on
Heard you not the type that you take home to Mom
Is we fucking when we leave the club or nah?
I ain't spending cash for nothing, I wanna see you take it off
I'ma pop this bottle, you gon' give me brain or nah?
Heard you from the hood, you rep that thing or nah?
Got a lotta ass, you gonna shake that thing or nah?
Heard you smoke blunts, you down with paper planes or nah?
I feel like I'm Tony, you my boss? I'm thinking nah
The whole world, I take it on
Girl, make that ass clap for young dollar sign
You already know my money go a long time
I could slide for it, like Nelly
I'ma go as far as you let me
Girl, is you sucking me or fucking me or nah?
Can I bring another bitch? Let's have a threesome
Keep saying you's a freak, you gon' prove it or nah?
His bitch keep looking at me, she choosing or nah?
You a ride-or-die chick, you with this shit or nah?
Say you not a side bitch, you all-in or nah?
You gon' make them eggs cheesy with them grits or nah?
Can you do it like that, on this dick or nah?
You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying?
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach
A wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I am to you
Is a pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to
She's twisted, he's a lover, she's set, he's hard to handle
The worst part of all is he just don't care
She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a
(She don't give a shit)
Sometimes I wish that you'd just die
Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
(How did it come to this?
Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?)
I didn't know you feel the same
When I say you're no good
All you are to me
Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married? Well
Romeo, Romeo, smokin' blow with Antonio
In the back alley takin' shots of whiskey and only gold
Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse
And I'm sorry I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler then I'm gettin' the short change of it
Feel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel
Tangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then wake up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave and you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just want a free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside
Maybe I'm a twisted one that screwing this up
So i guess this means Goodbye, for now
  MMM-HMM-HMM
Uh-Huh, Ha-Ha-Ha, it's Iggy Iggs
I got one more problem with you, girl
(One less one less problem) Aye
Hey, Baby, even though I hate cha
I wanna love ya, I want yo-o-ou
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want ta, I want yo-o-ou
Tell me tell me, Baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it, I want yo-o-ou
Head in the clouds got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realize that I've got
One less problem without cha
I got one less problem without cha
I got one less problem without cha
I got one less one less problem
One less problem without cha
I got one less problem without cha
I got one less problem without cha
I got one less one less problem
I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up, but it's yo-o-ou
Know I shouldn't never call back
Or let you come back, but it's yo-o-ou
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it, but it's yo-o-ou
Head in the clouds got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realize that I've got
One less problem without cha
I got one less problem without cha
I got one less problem without cha
I got one less one less problem
One less problem without cha
I got one less problem without cha
I got one less problem without cha (Ooh, Babe)
I got one less one less problem (Ooh-Ooh-Oh)
It's Iggy Iggs
Uh, what you got?
Smart money betting I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgetting all about you
You saying that you know, but I really-really doubt you
Understand, my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy-Iggy too biggie to be here stressing
I'm thinking I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now, is probably for you to exit
I let you go let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-stepping either you want it or you just playing
I'm listening to you knowing I can't believe what you're saying
There's a million you's, Baby Boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one like what
MMM-No (One less one less problem)
MMM-Yeah (One less one less problem)
Head in the clouds got no weight on my shoulders
(One less one less problem)
I should be wiser and realize that I've got
(One less one less problem)
One less problem without cha
I got one less problem without cha (Babe)
I got one less problem without cha (Ooh Oh Babe)
I got one less one less problem (Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
One less problem without cha (Yeah I got)
I got one less problem without cha
I got one less problem without cha (Whoo-Whoo!)
I got one less one less problem
One less problem without cha (Uh, Hey-Aye)
I got one less problem without cha (Without you)
I got one less problem without cha (I got one less, one least, Yeah)
I got one less one less problem (Problem, Yeah-Eh)
  Aurinko kun päätti retken,
siskoistaan jäi jälkeen hetken
Hämärä jo mailleen hiipi,
päivänsäde kultasiipi
aikoi juuri lentää eestä sen,
Vaan menninkäisen pienen näki vastaan tulevan;
Kas, menninkäinen ennen päivän laskua ei voi
He katselivat toisiansa
menninkäinen rinnassansa
Sanoi: "Poltat silmiäni,
mutten ole eläissäni
nähnyt mitään yhtä ihanaa!
Ei haittaa vaikka loisteesi mun sokeaksi saa
Käy kanssani, niin kotiluolaan näytän sulle tien
ja sinut armaakseni vien!"
Mut säde vastas: "Peikko kulta,
pimeys vie hengen multa,
Pois mun täytyy heti mennä,
ellen kohta valoon lennä
niin en hetkeäkään elää saa!"
Ja niin lähti kaunis päivänsäde, mutta vieläkin
kun menninkäinen yksin tallustaa,
hän miettii miksi toinen täällä valon lapsi on
  Oh darling I
Know you're taken
Something 'bout this
Just don't feel right
Every time
One of us, tries to leave here
Oh the other one
Holds on tight
Oh oh
Baby tonight
There's so much love in between us
But you say you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul
You tell me someone
Waiting for ya
That you can't do this anymore
But you kiss me again
So go ahead and
Draw the blinds and
Lock all the doors
Baby tonight
There's so much love in between us
You say you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul
Oh if you want me
Like I want you
I won't judge you
This could be our little secret
Our secret
So tell me if you're ready
'Cause if no one knows then
It ain't really cheating
Oh darling I
Know you're taken
But something 'bout this
Just feels so right
Oh baby
'cause every time
One of us, tries to justify the situation
We just hold on tighter
Oh oh
Baby tonight
There's so much love in between us
You say you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul
  When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones And I will try to fix you
  Oh hey
Boy with your hat back
Mmm I kinda like that
If you wanna walk my way
I'mma shoot you straight up
Show me what you are made of
I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the games
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby
Do you got what it takes?
If you're gonna hold me hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me love me like you mean it
If you're gonna talk the talk you better walk it
If you wanna keep me keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me boy love me like you mean it
I've had my share of losers, liars and users
Looking for a heart to break
So if you're like that
Well take a step back
'Cause I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the game
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby
Are you just crazy or crazy over me
If you're gonna hold me hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me love me like you mean it
If you're gonna talk the talk you better walk it
If you're gonna keep me keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me love me like you mean it
If you're gonna hold me hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me love me love me
If you're gonna talk the talk you better walk it
If you're gonna keep me keep me like you lost it
If you're say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me love me like you mean it
Love me like you mean it
Love me like you mean it
  Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngen' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them
Hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deep and
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before"
Damn
I wrote back and said "Of course I had sex before"
Knowing I was frontin'
I said I'm like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know that
So she done wrote back and told me
"Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'"
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you laying on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like "Yeah baby sound like a plan"
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin
Fuck
You know that feelin' when you you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying "God don't let me bust quick"
I'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in her crib now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
"I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you a pro, but baby be gentle cause"
  Let it rain
Let it rain
Open the flood gates of Heaven
Let it rain
Let it rain
Open the flood gates of Heaven
(Repeat)
The Lord reigns
Let the earth be glad
Let the distant shores rejoice
Clouds and thick darkness surround Him
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of
His throne
Fire goes before Him
And consumes His foes on every side
His lightning lights up the world
The earth sees and trembles
The mountains melt like wax
Before the Lord of all the earth
The heavens proclaim His righteousness
Let it rain
Let it rain
Open the flood gates of Heaven
Let it rain
Let it rain
(Repeat)

It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryna hold on but didn't even know
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard, and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall, to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
Doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
Despite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard, and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall, to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I put my trust, in you
Pushed as far as I can go, and for all this
There's only one thing you should know
I put my trust! In you!
Pushed as far as I can go! And for all this!
There's only one thing you should know!
I tried so hard, and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall, to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
  Mm, you smell that?
You know what that smell is?
That's right, it's money
Go ahead, rub your dick on that shit
I rub my dick on expensive shit
I rub my dick on expensive shit
It's like a dream cum true, I'm livin' da dream bro
I'm rubbing my dick on expensive shit
Told my daddy I was gonna grow up to be
A superstar rapper, making big money, you know what I mean girl?
But my daddy told me I was living in a dream world
If I said 'Yes dad' I wouldn't have my zef swag
Or fly 'round the whole fuckin' world getting jet-lag
Gettin' beaten by the zef bug is the best drug
If I played it safe I would've never made it ever
Now every day in every way I get a little zeffer
No matter what you smoke you'll never get as high as me
It's like a fat fuck you when these naairs see
My billboard up in NYC
Don't you wieh your boyfriend was zef like me?
I'm the mother fucking greatest, suckers love to hate us
But I make these bitches submissive 'cause I'm a dominator
I'm mad musical, my rhymes are the tightest
That's why I tap beautiful designer vaginas
I rub my dick on expensive shit
I rub my dick on expensive shit
It's like a dream cum true, I'm livin' da dream bro
I'm rubbing my dick on expensive shit
Rubbing my laaney totti op watokal
Big money
Make my dreams cum true
Baby I'm a angel, sent from the dark side
Took my brush-cut to the next with peroxde
'Oh my Gord that's such a fresh switch!'
Yeah whatever, just don't touch the hair, bitch!
Everybody's crying saying: Hip-hop's dead
'Til a white south african hip-hop head
Pops up on the scene saying: It's not dead!
I'm here! Can I get a fuckin', aah, yeah?
Rappers looking at me like I just crawled out the drain
The underground got me bored out of my brain
And this pop-rap bullshit all sound the same
God help you if I call out your name
From the dark side of the moon, I zoom out the gloom
Doom, doom! The room goes boom like a cartoon
The dark raver has come, my mic-saber is on
Turn and tell your friend: Yo, this is my favourite song!
I rub my dick on expensive shit
I rub my dick on expensive shit
It's like a dream cum true, I'm livin' da dream bro
I'm rubbing my dick on expensive shit
Rubbing my laaney totti op watokal
Oh! Wat drink jy, ninjie?
I'm sipping Dom Perignon, Dom-Dom Perignon
Dom Perignon, Dom-Dom Perignon
I'm sipping Dom Perignon, Dom-Dom Perignon
Ooh lala! C'est si bon!
I'm sipping Dom Perignon, Dom-Dom Perignon
Dom Perignon, Dom-Dom Perignon
I'm sipping Dom Perignon, Dom-Dom Perignon
It's like a angel peed in my mouth! C'est si bon!

  Du säger att kärleken aldrig var till för dig
Att du aldrig känt vinden högt över trädtoppen
Du säger att den delar sig vid kinden
Och blir hel igen bakom dig
Varje moln är trasigt
Du räknar allt sorgligt natten lång
Och hon du älskade en gång
Och kanske älskar än
Spelar det någon roll?
Nej kanske ingen
Kanske allt egentligen
Du säger 'har du tändstickor?'
- Ja tillräckligt om du vill bränna ner stockholm
'Och har du vin och sprit?'
- Så att det räcker att få hela fjärden full av sorger
Allt, det är för sent
För sent för vin, för sent för kärlek ren som snö
Inatt finns ingen väg tillbaks
Och du undrar vem som kysser henne nu
Du undrar vem
Vem om inte du
Och läpparna, du kallade dina
Det gör ont att veta
Men lika ont att undra
Du säger 'har du tändstickor?'
- Ja tillräckligt om du vill bränna ner stockholm
'Och har du vin och sprit?'
- Så att det räcker för att få hela fjärden full av sorger
Allt, det är för sent
För sent för vin, för sent för kärlek ren som snö
Inatt finns ingen väg tillbaks, ingen alls
För sent för edelweiss
Ingen alls
För sent för edelweiss
Ingen alls
För sent för edelweiss

My arms are wide, catching fire as the wind blows
I know that I'm rich enough for pride, I see a billion dollars in your eyes
Even if were strangers til we die
I wanna run away
I wanna run away
Anywhere out this place
I wanna run away
Just U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I (x3)
Just U and I
I wanna run
Chase the morning sun when I'm with U
Give it all away
Catching fire as the wind blows
I know that I'm rich enough for pride, I see a billion dollars in your eyes
Even if were strangers til we die
I wanna run away
I wanna run away
Anywhere out this place
I wanna run away
Just U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I (x3)
Just U and I
Break 'em off somethin
Just wakin up in the mornin gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog (damn)
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Thinkin will I live, another twenty-fo'
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Lookin in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all
Which park, are y'all playin basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
I can't believe, today was a good day (shit!)
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin, didn't even look in a nigga's direction
as I ran the intersection
Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break 'em
with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Lil' Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin domino
Today was a good day (shit!)
Left my nigga's house paid (what)
Picked up a girl been tryin to fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the mornin got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, "Ice Cube's a pimp" (yeah)
Drunk as hell but no throwin up
Half way home and my pager still blowin up
I got to say it was a good day (shit!)
Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh, stop this shit
What the fuck I'm thinkin about?
  I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun,
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I'll be doin' this, if you ever doubt,
And I feel alright, and I feel alright,
I'll be doin' this, if you ever doubt,
I'll be running, I'll be running,
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down,
Momma said "do what you want, say prayers at night",
I'll be running, I'll be running,
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down,
Oh for God, for fate,
For love, for hate,
For gold, and rust,
I'll be our light, your match, your burning sun,
I'll be running, I'll be running,
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down,
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun,
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down,
  i know you way before i know you existed
sirens across the room
i can feel your energy i dont wanna miss it
taking over all of me
follow it signals
something so natural
its like a chemical reaction
i cant let you know
There's only one chance before it comes and goes
take a step closer just lose control
it could be so easy
no need to hurry
every little thing could change in a heartbeat
every little thing
every little thing
every little thing could change in a heartbeat
every little thing
every little thing
every little thing could change in a heartbeat
tearing walls down, here and now
Our desire screaming out loud in the sun
Crushing deep from within me
can't you see that everything we need is right between you and me
There's only one chance before it comes and goes
take a step closer just lose control
it could be so easy
no need to hurry
every little thing could change in a heartbeat every little thing
every little thing
  I'm waking up to ash and dust,
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust,
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
(Enough) to make my systems blow
(Instrumental)
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
(Enough) to make my systems blow
I'm waking up, I'm waking up, I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
(Enough) to make my systems blow

On the fields of Breitenfeld
Fire at will
Aim for their cannons
Counter attack
Thunder of guns

All together Gott mit uns

Seven times they attacked on that day
Seven times they retreated
Cavarly charge
Follow the banner
After the king
Freedom we bring
Gott mit uns

All together Gott mit uns
From the old world's demise

From the north reaching far

Breaking their lines
Thousands of soldiers
Run for their lives
Legend arise

Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill/
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded faded faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you (aah)
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby/ drunk in love/ we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
beautiful bodies grinding up in that club/
Drunk in love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night/ and everything alright
No complaints from my body so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing if you scared, call that reverand
Boy, I'm drinking/ get my brain right
Armand de brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets/ he sweat it out like wash rags he wear it out
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard/
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body
Been serving all this, swerve, surfing all of this good, good/
(Nice) Hold up
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumbled all in that house time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that 3rd,
I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, ah
Foreplay in the foyer fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights you gon' need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night
Never tired/ never tired
I've been sipping/
that's the only thing that's keeping me on fire/me on fire
didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire/
I've been drinking/watermelon
I want your body right here daddy/
I want you/right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty/
Daddy I want you/
(looove)
  Oh boy!
Oh boy!
Så upp och hoppa, det är sol idag,
Nej, lämna idet och häng med mig ut
Oh boy!
Oh boy!
Ja, tänk ändå att man kan bli så glad
Och barnet i en kommer hem igen
Oh Boy!
Oh boy!
Oh boy!
Så enkelt som att sträcka ut en hand,
och torka gruset av en barnakind,
Oh boy!
Oh boy!
Rena gudagåvan, är det konstigt att jag är glad?
För solen skiner ju, och du är här,
Och faktiskt när man mår på detta vis,
Oh Boy! (x5)
Vilket vackert väder!
Oh Boy! (x4)
Boy!

  Look here
There's something to know
I'm not like others
This needs to go slow
Got things,
things on my mind
Visions to make
And gold dust to find
It's not you
It's defenitely me
Got dreams to believe in
And bright lights to see
No spark
Startin' to doubt
I've got the feeling
That this won't work out
I'm diggin'
Don't want you by my side
Me and my records all alone feels right
I'm diggin'
Need to grow
Have to push
Flicking through venyl and feeding the rush
I dig for that one
And I open the haunt
It's takin' all day
From the back to the front
I'm diggin' and diggin'
You know
Sorry baby gone diggin'
oeh ah oeh ah oeh
To find gold
Need plenty of souls
And everyone needs
Their seperate goals
This band
Makes me inspired
They have the flames
That light up my fire
Although
Already sold
But it doesn't mean
The story's untold
I'm near in finding the sound
Don't have the feeling
I'm hanging around
I'm diggin'
Don't want you by my side
Me and my records all alone feels right
I'm diggin'
Need to grow
Have to push
Flicking through venyl and feeding the rush
I dig for that one
And I open the haunt
It's taking all day
From the back to the front
I'm diggin' and diggin'
You know
Sorry baby gone diggin'
oeh ah oeh ah oeh ah oeh ah
oeh ah oeh ah oeh ah oeh
From (mina) to (ella)
(ella) to (bessy)
(bessy) to (atack) and (merela) with me
(mina) to (ella)

I'm diggin'
I'm diggin' it out
I'm dig dig dig dig diggin' it out
I'm diggin'
I'm diggin' it out
Baby, i've gone dig dig diggin'!
I'm diggin'
Don't want you by my side
Me and my records all alone feels right
I'm diggin'
Need to grow
Have to push
Flicking through venyl and feeding the rush
I dig for the one
And I open the haunt
It's taking all day
From the back to the front
I'm diggin' and diggin'
You know
Sorry baby gone diggin'
I'm diggin'
Don't want by my side
Me and my records all alone feels right
I'm diggin'
Need to grow

Flicking through venyl and feeding the rush
I dig for the one
And I open the haunt
It's taking all day
From the back to the front
I'm diggin', I'm diggin'
You know
Sorry baby gone diggin'

You want me down on Earth, but I am up in space
You're so damn hard to please, we gotta kill this switch

YOUNG MULA, BABY!
(Haha, you thought it was over?)
I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowning up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart
When she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch your inch
When she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga's bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the bay with me
Eyes closed smoking marijuana
Rolling up that Bob Marley, I'm a rasta
She wanna do drugs, smoke weed, get drunk
She wanna see a nigga trap
She wanna fuck all the rappers
Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, let's get to it (right away)
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
That's a no-no girl
All this money in the air
I wanna see you dance
Uhhhh
Rich young nigga
Name got bigger and my change got bigger
So my chains got bigger
Ferrari, Jaguar, switching four lanes
With the top down screaming out, "money ain't a thing"
Hah, me and CB in the bay with her
Send her back home so you can lay with her
Okay, let's talk about this ice that I'm carrying
All these karats like I'm a fucking vegetarian
Rose rolex, hoes on deck
She know I got a check
Do it too good when she ride that dick
Man I wouldn't trust that bitch
No!
Come on, come on, girl
Why you fronting?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl
Why you fronting?
Baby show me something
You done spent your bread on her
And it's all for nothing
It's been a long road but we're finally here
And the view from the top so beautifully clear
We can see for forever not a cloud in the sky
Picture perfect weather everyday of our lives
Just imagine if everything you wanted came true
Well it happened to me so it can happen to you
We're on a journey of truth and belief is the key
So open up your heart and let your life free
Oh
And I feel like I'm glowing
And I like where I'm going
Tonight, I'm showing up to shine
This little light of mine (OK, OK, OK)
I'm gonna let it shine (Alright, alright, alright)
This little light of mine (OK, OK, OK)
I'm gonna let it shine (Alright, alright, alright)
This little light of mine (OK, alright, OK)
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
Front to back we're packing, stomping
Clapping, laughing, singing, dancing
Passion ever lasting
When I'm rapping to the tracking
Let's get everyone to put your hands up
Stand up
Roxanne come take my hand
And make the congregation rock
Celebrating and it feels so good
If I could thank everybody here I would
I feel like I'm finally free and I
Yeah I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to fly
Yeah, oh
And I feel like I'm glowing
And I like where I'm going
Tonight, I'm showing up to shine
This little light of mine (OK, OK, OK)
I'm gonna let it shine (Alright, alright, alright)
This little light of mine (OK, OK, OK)
I'm gonna let it shine (Alright, alright, alright)
This little light of mine (OK, alright, OK)
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
You know it wants to come out
Don't hide your shine, y'all
Now put your hands to in sky
'Cause your light is your love
This little light of mine (This little light of mine)
I'm gonna let it shine (I'm gonna let it shine)
This little light of mine (Yeah)
I'm gonna let it shine (I'm gonna let it shine)
This little light of mine (This little light of mine)
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, shine
This one goes out to all sides world wide
Let that play ass nigga thumpy be your guide
As we go on a ride with playa hatin' killers and hood niggas thrive
And lame mah'fuckers can barely survive
Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my whip so big when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down
What this shit costs?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now
I hope it ain't talk, no
I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up?
Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours"
On a blimp?
Tell her be free, baby spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you 30 thousand feet
On your knees in them Prada's
Makin' freaky shit come up out her
Get high baby roll one, cloud nine, 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up
When we land we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know about
Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out
I got you in the air, your body in the air
How it feel up here?
You can scream as loud as you want, and loud as you can
And ain't nobody gonna hear
Would you like it better
If I hit the west coast?
Tell me, if you 'bout that life right now
I hope it ain't talk
Cole World, I got it, I got it, I got it, listen
You need a nigga that's gon' come over and dig you out
You need a nigga that you know is not gon' run his mouth
You need a nigga when he done probably gon' put you out
You need a nigga that's gon' put it in your mouth
Dick so big it's like a foot is in yo' mouth
And y'ain't babysitting, but my kids all on yo' couch
And oh, you nasty, oh, oh, you nasty
Both graduated so fuck keepin' it classy
Look, they love me in the Chi like MJ
They love me in the Chi like Oprah
No nigga could block, not even Dikembe
Compared to Cole, boy, you're softer than a sofa
And so far my new shit's so fire, nigga, check my profile
Who you know make waves in a low tide?
Deebo'ed yo' bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thang in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So god damn don't make me beg
But I will if I need to cause for real, girl, I need you
I could put you on a flight, we could take off tonight
If you scared of heights, shit I got a pill I could feed you
Cole
  Baby you don't need to be scared of me
I guarantee that I'm not a mistake
I'mma give you all of my love
And I hope that you won't misplace it
You created this shit
Going insane with all of this fear
Can't turn my back on it
I'm in love gotta' face it
You're the only one I wanna stay on the phone with
Oh the late night Skype sex
On that young shit
Girl you keep it one hunnit
Always gon' hold me down
You know you're the number one
Girl I'mma work you out
Ain't got much to say
I ain't about to make you wait
I'm just gon' take you from here
Girl let's ride away
Let's elevate, just elevate
Yeah girl let me take you for a ride
Baby let me change your life
Promise it will be alright
Baby take my hand tonight
Let me set you free now
Sweatin' like a waterbed (on me)
Keep puttin' that thang (on me)
Like you never did before
I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, right there
Right there, right there
Put it up right there (I'm gon' explore all of your body)
Put it up right there
Put it up right there (I love, I love you)
I'm gon' explore all of your body
I'mma write my name with my tongue on your back baby
Come on, just let me
I know you're ready
And even if there is a crowd
Let 'em see it
I'mma give you some more
Just let 'em all just say what they wanna say
That's how I feel, cause I'm in love
And the temperature just heats up
When I'm with you, don't be scared
When I start to go down and I lick you
Rubbin' and kissin' and lickin' on your body
When I go down and oh I'm gon' miss you
Gonna need your body right now
Cause I know it's an issue
And I'm hyperventilating right now
I can't breathe, If I ain't with you
I need your body like right now
I need your body like right now
Lay your head, on my bed
Baby tell me if you want the lights down
Your property, treat me like I'm your property
Do what you wanna, take command
I'm about to be your biggest fan
Your property, treat me like I'm your property
Do what you wanna, take command
I'm about to be your biggest fan
Baby let me change your life
Promise it will be alright
Baby take my hand tonight
Let me set you free now
Sweatin' like a waterbed (on me)
Keep puttin' that thang (on me)
Like you never did before
I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, right there
Right there, right there
Put it up right there (I'm gon' explore all of your body)
Put it up right there
Put it up right there (I love, I love you)
I'm gon' explore all of your body
Looking for too many places
Searching high and low for you
I'm stronger when I'm close to you
I'm seeing all familiar faces
Girl it's all about you, only you in my life
And I say, "You like playing with my heart?"
Baby, please don't do this to me
Cause I'm in love
Can I get a little bit? One more kiss?
Yeah I don't wanna miss it
Hey, I really wanna tell ya about my life
E-veryday, I like to pump and get hype
E-veryone, I know they love to get down
Everybody turn it up,
and then we'll turn the world around
round, round, round,
Round, round, round,
Round, round, round,
Oh, you know we are the infinity (x12)
Ink,ink,ink,
Ohh, o-ohh,
Rocking down, don't need your facility
I don't care, I don't mind, I like to leave my fears behind
I levitated to a cosmic flow
Everybody better gets this flow
Come on, let's lose this flow
Here we go, here we go
Moving it up, shaking it up, rocking it down,
Infinity ink, we got that sound (x4)
Don't where it started and I don't know when it ends
I feel so much pressure that I don't like get the bans
I'm reaching with no effort into the galaxy
If you wanna be, oh, you know we are the infinity
And if you wanna see, oh, you know we are the infinity
(x4)
Ink,ink,ink ,
  Can't think, can't sleep, can't breathe
Everything gettin' harder to find
Everybody jumpin' out of they mind
Everybody goin' out of they skins
See we get to the end but that's where we begin
You feel it
Mannequins say "We breakin' the mold"
Breakin' out and we breakin' the codes
Similar to the Jacques Cousteau
To the depths and you're wet
So your tank explodes, so get it out
Send your body to flight
Everybody got a target tonight
Everybody come along for the ride
All you studs and you duds and you ladies, let's fly
Grip the moment like you grippin' the earth
Feel the weight and you feelin' the girth
Now you get it, now you feelin' your worth
Feel the sound you used to make when everything used to hurt
It goes
Oh, no time to rest
Just do your best
Oh, what you hear is not a test
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you go
Gotta go, gotta make it in time
Brightest star gonna be the guide
Gotta get you to the other side
To where the butterflies and where the peach reside
The first five minutes for the fifteen of fame
Five seconds 'fore you're saying my name
I'm deadly sharpshooting the game
Gonna hit you and this whole execution is aim
Get together and we building a fire
Clear smoke and it's taking us higher
Hands up, everyone is one
If you see yourself making it
You're seeing the sun
Metropolis on the edge of control
They take our money, but they won't take our soul
Forget, ain't gon' do it no mo'
Won't do what we told and we ain't gonna fold
We go
Oh, no time to rest
Just do your best
Oh, what you hear is not a test
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Can't think, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't think, can't sleep, can't breathe
Everybody jumpin' out of they mind
Everybody goin' out of they skins
Everybody jumpin' out of they mind
Everybody goin' out of they skins
Oh, no time to rest
Just do your best
Oh, what you hear is not a test
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you go
  Listen to the wind blow
coming from a forest land
chasing every car not every broken avenue
Unlike we do, you and me Won't you feel the water flow
down our rivers that will never end
They will never try to understand
Turn the stone into sand as they go-o-oo
Take me back to understand
Deep inside our hearts no
We don't make the wind blow
Look and see the little one
is running through the rain storms
The dark and the dirt didn't bother us then
like the long lost friend, I still remember that
Looking up at the Levant stars
we were dancing in an open sky
And with open eyes,
and our minds as open
Take me back to understand
Deep inside our hearts no
We don't make the wind blow
Take me back to understand
Deep inside our hearts no
We don't make the wind blow
Instrumental
We don't make the wind blow
Deep inside our hearts no
We don't make the wind blow
Take me back to understand
Deep inside our hearts no
We don't make the wind blow
Take me back to understand
Deep inside our hearts no
We don't make the wind blow
Deep inside our hearts no
We don't make the wind blow

Are you ready for the roughneck bass
  Kick the dust up
All week long it's a farming town, they're making that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights backing up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come girl, kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac
We go way out where there ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
End up in a four door
Burning up a backroad song
Park it and we pile out, baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up, up
And kick the dust up
Bar downtown they got a line of people way out the door
10 dollar drinks, it's packed inside
I don't know what they're waiting for
Got me a jar full of 'Clear
And I got that music for your ear
And it's like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people
We go way out where there ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
End up in a four door
Burning up a backroad song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up, up
And kick the dust up
Just follow me down 'neath the 32 bridge
You all gonna be glad you did
Kick it
We go way out where there ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
End up in a four door
Burning up a backroad song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up (kick the dust up)
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That's what's up, up
Let's kick the dust up
(Drumma Boy)
August
Young Money
I swear this is my favorite shit {coughs}
I'm deadass
Green light
You know Imma make that shit official
Believe we had a great night and yes girl I am the type to tell you
that I miss you shit
You don't like that I make this easy, Staying
After sexing on the floor
Baby I know you need me, like I need you
I'm the one you wanna love
So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a different nigga you see
You use to them but you best loving me
I hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party till we can't, you best loving me
And I'm the one to blame, stay loving me
So look for love
( come looking for love)
Shawty if you looking for somebody tryna settle down
Probably shouldnt be around nah baby
You should hit when you tired of playing up in the house
And ain't nobody around
You need that
When you need that late night
We can both make love to the daylight
You got it girl, you got it girl
But you know Imma stay right? Uh nah babe
All I want is you so what you tryna do?
August you know, I'm here to save you
Me and them girls, we ain't the same boo
You know I hate it, when you stay here
Cause you love it but you need to beat it
But you know how bad I need it
You're so fuckin' conceited
Why you coming over weeded
You can't treat me like you treat them
Yes, I am the crème de la crème
Yes I am from one to one, one
You fronting in them streets, saying we just married
You can't front like this ain't way realer
I know you hard, I know that you a killer
I know you started off a dope dealer
But let your guard down, your niggas know you feel her, feel her
So what you want, baby?
(All I want is you)
(So what you trying to do?)
  I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche"
But no one gives us any time anymore
He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it then you ran off
I've got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said
"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he will fall
One thousand lonely stars, hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't want to sing anymore
"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a
I don't understand, don't get upset, I'm not with you
Thoughts swimming around, it's all I do, when I'm with you
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
  Över plattorna på Sergels torg, där himlen är tung av sorg
Jag väntar fast jag redan vet
Sänker mitt huvud ner
Om du skulle se tillbaks nån gång
Har allt gått tillbaks till noll
Nu faller regnet över oss
Men filmen börjar om och om
När allt är slut
Vad gör väl det om 100 år, när vi är tillbaks på 0?
Jag vet att du vill ha det så
Men vad spelar det för jävla roll, om det inte kan bli vi nån gång?
Vad finns det då att bry sig om, över plattorna på Sergels torg?
Fast det kommer blåsa upp till storm
Står jag där jag alltid stått
Jag stryker bort en ensam tår
Du vänder dig om och går
Som om det aldrig nånsin hänt
Ser stjärnorna lysa än
Mitt hjärta kanske slutar slå
Men filmen börjar om ändå
När allt är slut
Vad gör väl det om 100 år, när vi är tillbaks på 0?
Jag vet att du vill ha det så
Men vad spelar det för jävla roll, om det inte kan bli vi nån gång?
Vad finns det då att bry sig om, över plattorna på Sergels torg?
Gatorna töms, här finns inget att se
Ingenting glöms och det finns ingenting som du kan göra åt det
Allt på en gång
En gång till
En gång till
(När allt är slut
Vad gör väl det om 100 år?
Jag vet att du vill ha det så
Men jag förstår)
Men vad spelar det för jävla roll, om det inte kan bli vi nån gång?
Vad finns det då att bry sig om, (över plattorna på Sergels torg?)
När allt är slut
Vad gör väl det om 100 år?
(Över plattorna på Sergels torg)
Jag vet att du vill ha det så
Och jag förstår
(Över plattorna på Sergels torg)
Vad finns det då att bry sig om?

  Out the door just in time
Head down the 405
Gotta meet the new boss by eight am
The phone rings in the car
The wife is working hard
She's running late tonight again
Well, I know what I've been told
You've got to work to feed the soul
But I can't do this all on my own
No, I know
I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman
And you've got your love online
And you think you're doing fine
But you're just pluged into the wall
And that deck of Tarot cards
Won't get you very far
There ain't no hand to break your fall
Well, I know what I've been told
You've got to know just when to fold
But I can't do this all on my own
No, I know
I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman
(that's right)
You've crossed the finish line
Won the race but lost your mind
Was it worth it, after all
I need you here with me
Cause love is all we need
Just take a hold of the hand that breaks the fall
Well I know what I've been told
You've to break free to break the mold
But I can't do this all on my own
No, I can't do this all on my own
I know, that I'm no
Superman
I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman
Someday we'll be together
I'm no Superman
Someday
Someday we'll be together
Someday
I'm no Superman
  I've been sleeping with the lights on
Cause the darkness is surrounding you
This is my world, this is my choice
And you're the drug that gets me through
I've been waiting for an answer
Because I built this bed for two
I'm just waiting on your answer
I built this bed for me and you
Could you see that I am yours?
So will you be my life support?
You're my life support
You're my life support
Sick of waking up in darkness
When the sky is always painted blue
There's a method to my madness
It's clear that you don't have a clue
I've been waiting for an answer
Because I built this bed for two
I'm just waiting on your answer
I built this bed for me and you
Could you see that I am yours?
So will you be my life support?
You're my life support
You're my life support
You're my life support
You're my life support
Can't you see that I am yours?
So will you be my life support?
I've been sleeping with the lights on
Cause the darkness is surrounding you
  I found myself dreaming of
Silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight
And you held me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone
I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
And I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
And I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer baby
Any chance that I get
And I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regret
So let's take the time to say what we want
Here's what we got before its all gone
No, we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
And I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
Hey
Whoa
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
Yeah, yeah
Like I'm gonna lose you

   din dörr
  Diamond rings, and old bar stools
One's for queens, and one's for fools
One's the future, and one's the past
One's forever, and one won't last
It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
It ain't like watered down whiskey and coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hope
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old bar stools
Wrongs and rights, the highs and lows
The I love you's, the I told you so's
Last few miles to wherever's home
Another morning waking up alone
It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
It ain't like watered down whiskey and coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hope
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old bar stools
It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
Nothing like watered down whiskey and coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hope
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old bar stools
Yo!
I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody, but tape
Yeah, that was a setup, for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt's fake, worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasonin'
And tell 'em bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, lowkey it may be high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that's cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up
So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, AYE!)
I never fucked Nick and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin', ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like gold is yellow
All my goons, so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up, if she wave
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses, with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the B out, behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off
Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"
Money, money, money
It's young Khalifa man
And I got money, hoes, money and hoes
I got money, hoes, money and hoes
Big money talking to you
Muthaf-cker thats cause big money bought it to you
I'll be stuntin while them little n-ggas sayin' nothing
High ceilings, high hoes, high prices for my clothes
and I don't even pay for it
Barely no major shit
Need a bitch, take a bitch, straight back to that big crib
Let you roll some rapper weed, put you on some new shit
Hit this weed, I show you how I do this
My excuse is I'm in Cali so my smoke's highly exclusive
And my bitch bad, my money's through the roof
Your money short you looking mad
You Danny Bonaduce bitch
I'm jumpin' in my coupe
I'm rollin' something that taste like fruit
And I hear them n-ggas talkin' shit
but theres nothing much that they can do
When I got a bitch in your city, you should try when you see her
Never trippin' on no hoes, n-gga
what you thought we gettin' money over here
I'm ballin' hard, my n-ggas in the same game
I do it big my n-ggas do the same thing
I'm throwin' signs, it's looking like I gang bang
I'm on the team, it's lookin like I gang bang
I'm rolling up, my n-ggas roll the same thing
I'm smokin' weed, my bitch smoke the same thing
I'm throwin signs it's looking like I gang bang
I tell a bitch bow down to a muthaf-cking G hoe
I work hard, I drink slow
But I never keep drinks low, smokey smokey cause I'm a cheapo
Sippin' on Pinot Grigio, really hoe,
got everything like I got me a genie hoe, yeah
My car look like a building, diamonds dancing on top of my wrist
Bitch I'm ten feet tall when I'm standing on top of my dick
You a sucker hoe, sucka hoe
I'm success, I feel like a million dollars, bitch I'm up next
Money in my hand, I don't need no hand out
And they all got their hands up cause they f-ck with me hands down
And the car I push got more tent than a camp round
And my picture always on your bitch background
Like Prada, it's just me and Cyhi
Young enough to be your son, but she call me big papa
She gave me her oh nana, now disappear like tada
She smoking on that Tada, now who the f-ck gon stop her
I'm ballin' hard, my n-ggas in the same game
I do it big my n-ggas do the same thing
I'm throwin' signs, it's looking like I gang bang
I'm on the team, it's lookin like I gang bang
I'm rolling up, my n-ggas roll the same thing
I'm smokin' weed, my bitch smoke the same thing
I'm throwin signs it's looking like I gang bang
  This is the story of a brother
Who slept and woke up in forever land
He looked around nothing's familiar
He wondered how he got to be there
He took a walk around the city
And saw this brick house with a small door
Walked into the room and saw a man in white
Mr angel I'm a stranger don't know what's going on
The last thing I remembered was I slept last night
This is the border town that takes you where you get a crown
Must have heard of heaven where you came from
Only those whose name I find written in this book of life
Will forever be in paradise
Is your name in this book of life
Is your name in this book of life yeah
Ta da da,ta da da da,ta da da da da da da
Flipping the pages of this great book
This brother gave a puzzled gaze
He saw the names of prophets,saints and marthys
who kept the faith and won the race
But he said Mr angel! Where is my name
Can you tell me what is going on
I'm a pillar in my local church
Gave the offerings and the tithe
Feed the poor and have myself a good name
Is my name in this book of life
Is my name in this book of life yeah
Tell me is my name in this book of life
Is my name in this book of life yeah
Unforgiveness lurks within your heart
Some folks that you'll never let go
Little foxes and secret folks
Will spring surprises on that final day
Wow oh oh oh,wow oh,oh oh,oh
So much for this wonder brother
What about you,what about me
Let him that thinks that he stands
Let him take heed lest he falls
Only the pure in heart will see Jesus
Those whose garments filled with purity
Is your name in that book of life
Is your name in that book of life yeah
Is your name in that book of life
Tell me is your name in that book of life yeah
  You hold your breath because you feel
It might be the last one that you can steal, let it out
Reach inside the emptiness
Chase away the shadows and the doubt, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
You're cold and broken down your
World's cracked and upside down
You feel a million miles away from home (Away from home)
Just lose yourself inside my eyes
Release your pain to open skies
I'll catch you when you're ready to let go
You are not alone, you are not alone
Fix your eyes on all that's real
It's gonna pass don't be afraid to feel, don't hold it in
And crawl inside this hope again
Open your eyes this is where we begin, Oh
You're cold and broken down your
World's cracked and upside down
You feel a million miles away from home (Away from home)
Just lose yourself inside my eyes
Release your pain to open skies
I'll catch you when you're ready to let go
You are not alone, you are not alone
(Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh) No you are not alone
(Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh) No you are not alone
You're tired out of control
A broken heart a beating soul
You carry the weight of the world on your own (On your own)
Just lose yourself inside my eyes
Release your pain to open skies
I'll catch you when you're ready to let go
You are not alone, you are not alone
(Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh) You are not alone
You are not alone (Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
No you are not alone
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
When the going got rough
Show 'em what I done thought that was the worse, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
The messiest thing you've ever gone through is your purse
Yeah, I don't try like Captain, I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself
Inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go
In the waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
When you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put a spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise
Never take back what you say
If you stay trapped in your brain, engage in this fueled cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists to his bones
Show Biggie who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Yeah I picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it off like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that
Step into the unknown
And find yourself your glory, free the ignoring person
Got a fuckin' mouth with no shut-up valve
Can't even cut the power to it, when it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfucking tongue to tie, I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield, I'ma knife this will
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face it, each challenge waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Managed to prove who the best man is
Surveil it, all cards be the only ones left standing
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am
  My life be like Ooh Ahh
It's times like these that make me say,
Leavin bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip
(flow fingertip flow fingertip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
Got a heartfelt desire be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire by the things that i do
I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded
Low key and stayin' candid
Reflectin on the things I try my hand at
Search for the equations to persuasions I'm used to
Findin comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to
A mountainous fontaine,
Spinnin and monsoonin
Grinnin its high octane
This worlds out wacky
Rollin down the hills cause lifes a hassle
Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle
Stay afloat,
Catch a second wind thin is the air I breathe
Teary-eyed nose runnin, wipe the snot on my sleeve
I'm callin on my savior to be all that I need
Please forgive me my behavior had me lost at light speed
The fear of never falling in love
And the tears after losing the feelings
Of what you thought love was
Like the dirt still up under the rug
(My life be like)
Bad characteristics covered in Christ's blood
The joy of new birth and the pain of growing up
The bliss between giving my all and giving up
The highs and lows,
Paths and roads I chose
In the cold I froze
Trying to ease my woes
In this world of sin
Clothes to thin to fend
So to God I send
Words of help to win
In grumblings so deep letters could never express
So the sounds of Ooh Ahh beneath my breath projects
My life be like (Toby Mac)
My life be like ooh aah ooh
Dum dum diddy
Here comes that boy from the capital city
Last up on the Grits new ditty
But eight bars of the truth will do, eh
I believe there's a pride thats stunning,
And I believe in the kingdom coming
I believe if you seek the truth,
You don't need to look far cuz it's gonna find you
So why, oh why, do I trip and stumble?
And ooh ahh as commitments crumble?
I can't believe that I'm here again?
  If I were a boy, even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning and throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys, and chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted and I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy, I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken so they think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first and make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful, waiting for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-oh-oohh-oh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You got it wrong
But you're just a boy
And you don't understand (yea, you don't understand, oh!)
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Because you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy
  With a tiny rope and a bag of stones and all heartbroken wishingbone
She's going in, she's going home
Oh this little golden eye
Fighting heavy day behind the light, behind the light
Walking faster down the street with eyes and no shoes on her feet
This is farewell, this is goodnight
The last time she will see the daylight
See the daylight
And she's going on a journey
Always walking down the road
And the water is always calling
My little child, please come home
That's when she went away
Away from the light of day
Standing by the riverside
Patientelly waiting for the tide to come along
To come along
The water going through her feet and on her body wind so cold and sweet
So cold and sweet
And she's going on a journey
Always walking down the road
And the water is always calling
My little child, please come home
And the stars were brightly shining
When she reached out they were gone
And the water started calling
My little child, please come home
Feel the water in her body, water's never going out x8
And she's going on a journey
Always walking down the road
And the water is always calling
My little child, please come home
And the stars were brightly shining
When she reached out they were gone
And the water started calling
My little child, please come home
When a shiny light hit her eye
And she turned around and climbed towards the sky
Towards the sky
  [Jag borde ha förstått då när du tittade bort
Att allting har ett slut
Att allt det vackra är kort
Nu sitter jag och fryser på en regnig perrong
Och här kommer alla känslorna på en och samma gång
Här kommer alla känslorna på en och samma gång
Vi möttes mitt i vintern när mitt hjärta var tömt
Jag placera' dej i drömmen som jag borde ha glömt
Nu faller den från himlen som en trasig ballong
Och här kommer alla känslorna på en och samma gång
Här kommer alla känslorna på en och samma gång
Jag sitter ensam kvar och hör varje tåg
Vissla hallå ifrån ett ringlande spår
Var är du?
Man kan undra när timmarna går
Du borde sett hur underbart jag mår
Jag ska bygga mej en båt och segla tills det blir vår
Jag ska försöka att förtränga doften av ditt hår
Jag ska skrika så det hörs igenom all grå betong
För här kommer alla känslorna på en och samma gång
Här kommer alla känslorna på en och samma gång
Jag sitter ensam kvar och hör varje tåg
Vissla hallå ifrån ett evigt spår
Men det är slut
Det är dags att slå en knut
Öppna grinden för nu går jag ut
Här kommer alla känslorna på en och samma gång
Här kommer alla känslorna på en och samma gång]
  Laughs and jokes
And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared
Not that we ever cared
Well, the holes in the walls
Were such a lot
Welcome to London town
But when you're new to it all
And you think you're hot
You're not planning on hanging around
People would go on their different ways
I left to start a band
A note came through the letter box
In your childlike hand
Oh, laughs and jokes
And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared
Not that we ever cared
One day I rode to where you were
The doorbell jangled a note
They buzzed me in
I climbed the stairs
In my boots and leather coat
There's an old brass
Standing there at the top
Without her witch's broom
It almost seemed like a knocking shop
When the girls came out of their rooms
And they all stood around
And stared at me
Two brunettes and a blonde
Then the old brass shrugged and said
We don't know where she's gone
Later on I picked up the ball
And I took off down the line
I suppose by then I'd realised
You'd run into hard times
Oh, laughs and jokes
And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared
Not that we ever cared
Walking through a crowd, the village's aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said
Welcome to New York!
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York!
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack
I can dance to this beat (beat)
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me (me)
Welcome to New York!
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
Lord I lift your name on high
Lord I love to sing your praises
I'm so glad you are in my life
You came from heaven to earth, to show the way
From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay
From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky
You came from heaven to earth, to show the way
From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay
From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky
You came from heaven to earth, to show the way
From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay
From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky
You came from heaven to earth, to show the way
From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay
From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky
Lord I lift your name on high
Lord I lift your name on high
Lord I lift your name on high
Lord I lift your name on high
Lord I lift your name on high
  Got a secret
Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it, in your pocket
Taking this one to the grave
If I show you then I know you
Won't tell what I said
Cause two can keep a secret
If one of them is dead,
Why do you smile
Like you've been told a secret
Now you're telling lies
Cause you have sworn to keep it
But no one keeps a secret
No one keeps a secret
Why when we do our darkest deeds
Do we tell?
They burn in our brains
Become a living hell
Cause everybody tells
Everybody tells,
Got a secret
Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it, in your pocket
Taking this one to the grave
If I show you then I know you
Won't tell what I said
Cause two can keep a secret
If one of them is dead,
Look into my eyes
Now you're getting sleepy
Are you hypnotized
By secrets that you're keeping?
I know what you're keeping
I know what you're keeping
Got a secret
Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it, in your pocket
Taking this one to the grave
If I show you then I know you
Won't tell what I said
Cause two can keep a secret
If one of them is dead,
Alison?
I have something I want to tell you, but
Do you swear on your life?
You swore you'd never tell,
You swore you'd never tell,
You swore you'd never tell,
You swore you'd never tell,
Got a secret
Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it, in your pocket
Taking this one to the grave
If I show you then I know you
Won't tell what I said
Cause two can keep a secret
If one of them is dead,
Got a secret
Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it, in your pocket
Taking this one to the grave
If I show you then I know you
Won't tell what I said
Cause two can keep a secret
If one of them is dead,
Got a secret
Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it, in your pocket
Taking this one to the grave
If I show you then I know you
Won't tell what I said
Cause two can keep a secret
If one of them is dead,
Yes two can keep a secret
Yes two can keep a secret
  Love
Laid its breath against my chest
My skin was thick
But You breathed down all my walls
Love
Like the fire steals the cold
The icer wore thin
As Your light tore through my door
You have my heart
You have my heart
You have my heart oh God
You have my heart
Oh hallelujah
Hallelujah
Oh hallelujah
I found Your love
When I lost my heart to You
Love
Trading crowns to wear my shame
The Prince's throne for the cross that bore my thorns
Oh love
Like crashing waves of endless grace
You won't relent
Until all I am is Yours
(Dont Worry, Be happy)
  (instrumental)
  You were never truly loved
You have only been betrayed
You were never truly nurtured
By churches of the state
You were left unprotected
To these wild and fragile lands
But you can rise up like a God
Arm yourself
You can be strong
You can build a nuclear power
Transform the earth to your desire
Free your mind from false beliefs
You can be the commander in chief
You can hide your true motives
To dismantle and destroy
Now you have finally have the code
I have given you the code
Fire
There's no country left
To love and cherish
It's gone, it's gone for good
It's you and me babe
Survivors
To hunt and gather memories
Of the great nation we were
There's no countries left
To fight and conquer
It's human nature
The greatest hunter
Will survive them all
There's no culture left
To love and cherish
It's gone, you know it's gone for good
A trillion memories
Lost in space and time forevermore

  dom var bara kids
men gifte sig ändå
på flygplatsen
och flög till krakow
och det var så mycket
som var sorgligt med den trippen
för han älskade henne inte
och hon märkte inget
badabapapa bapadapa
badabapapa bapadapa
och hennes nye kärlek
bände ner honom så lätt inför henne
utan att ens känna till den unge Werthers lidande
och det var första gången
han fick stryk av en främling
och hur skulle han kunna hålla tillbaka tårarna
badabapapa bapadapa
badabapapa bapadapa
och han fick resterna av Magdalena
när hon blitt dumpad av Ola
dom var snart i slutet av Casablanca
i den scenen han växte upp i
och precis så lämna han henne
på en dammig väg under ett träd
det var den sista gången han såg henne
man måste genom skam
man måste genom drömmar
man måste dö några gånger innan man kan leva
han somnade bakom
sina nya solglasögon
och han drömde att han inte behövde nån
och när han vakna
satt en lapp i hans panna
"Nu vet du allt om ingenting, din jävla sopa"
jag var tvungen att förändra nånting
du hade just lämnat mig
jag vakna upp och höll om en dunk gin
men i drömmen jag just drömt höll jag om dig
och jag såg min ungdom
trampa gasen i botten
och sen köra rakt in i en bergvägg
man måste dö några gånger innan man kan leva
man måste genom skam
man måste genom drömmar
man måste dö några gånger innan man kan leva
man måste genom skam
man måste genom drömmar
man måste dö några gånger innan man kan leva
man måste
man måste
man måste dö några gånger innan man kan leva
innan man kan leva

Främling, vad döljer du för mig i dina mörka ögon
En svag nyans av ljus nånstans men ändå
En främling, så känner jag för dig
Jag ber dig låt mig få veta
Vem vill du vara kan du förklara det för mig?
Som Mona Lisa har sitt leende
Så gömmer också du en hemlighet
Stjärnor jag ser dom vill gärna ta ner nå'n till dig
Där bortom himlen finns en evighet
Om du vill upptäcka den här med mig
Ta första stegen och visa mig vägen i kväll
En känsla och jag litar på den
Se'n blir vår kärlek aldrig främmande igen
Natten finns till för dig och mig
Glöm det som är omkring oss
Låt mig få komma låt mig få vara nära dig
Som Mona Lisa har sitt leende
Så gömmer också du en hemlighet
Stjärnor jag ser dom vill gärna ta ner nå'n till dig
Där bortom himlen finns en evighet
Om du vill upptäcka den här med mig
Ta första stegen och visa mig vägen i kväll
En känsla och jag litar på den
Se'n blir vår kärlek aldrig främmande igen
Då blir vår kärlek aldrig främmande igen
  I'll be everywhere, everybody know me
Super, super fresh, what a dope styling
Hunny on my wrist, couple karats on my neck
Givenchy, keep the chickens in check
All these car keys, drive them chickens to my crib
Jewel heel, got somebody slipping in my bed
She give me IQ, that mean she gimme a head
I just give the beats, I don't give a bread
'Cause we be in the club
Bottles on deck
And god dammit, god dammit
I'm feeling myself
'Cause I'mma get it all
And I'mma throw it up
Like god dammit, god dammit
I'm feeling myself
Look up in the mirror
And the mirror look at me
I be everywhere, everybody know me
Catch me in the club hundred bottles on me
I get busy like a one line
In the drop getting head baby never mind
We gettin' money why you playing with it
Pool in the crib you could land a water plane in it
Slick Rick looking at the mirror
Me and will table looking like the bar
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem
And I don't give a fuck that's my fuckin' problem
I rock the whole globe with no problemo
Been rocking coats since my first demo
And now I'm banging hoes in the continental
And I done seen me slidin' out my dope ride
I open up the doors, suicide
I came from the bottom, the sewer side
I made it to the top cus I do it fly
Feelin' fuckin' lucky like the fuckin' Irish
I see the whole game from my third Iris
I tour the whole word like a dirty pirate
To give the whole club some Miley Cyrus
Now everybody trippin' like they poppin' mollies
Up in the club, is where you can find me
I do it real big never do it tiny
If you about that bullshit please don't remind me
I step in this motherfucker just to make it work
I get on the floor just to make that booty twerk
Shake, shake that ass like a, like an expert
Shake, shake that ass like a, like an expert
I'll be everywhere, everybody know me
Super, super fresh, what a dope styling
Hunny on my wrist, couple karats on my neck
Givenchy, keep the chickens in check
All these car keys, drive them chickens to my crib
Jewel heel, got somebody slipping in my bed
She give me IQ, that mean she get a head
I just give the beats, so don't give a bread
'Cause we be in the club
Bottles on deck
And god dammit, god dammit
I'm feeling myself
'Cause I'mma get it all
And I'mma throw it up
Like god dammit, god dammit
I'm feeling myself
Doobie in my hand, Rollie on my wrist
Got a bottle of that thousand dollar champagne in my fist
Women of in your dreams sleep in my bed
So I don't need your brains I need my ass kissed
But all my homies like give me some head
Smoke joints till our eyes turn Indian red
Takes shots till our chests burn
We got papers, bottles, mollies, all this let's get it started
The bigger the bill, the bigger you ball
The bigger the watch, the bigger the car, the bigger the star
The bigger the chain, the farther you go, you already know
The bigger the bank that's more hoes, nigga
And I done spent a quarter milli on clothes
Coppin' them oldschools and puttin' foriegns on the road
Real talk and if my fuel get low
I roll up another joint take a shot and reload, pow
I'll be everywhere, everybody know me
Super, super fresh, what a dope styling
Hunny on my wrist, couple karats on my neck
Givenchy, keep the chickens in check
All these car keys, drive them chickens to my crib
Jewel heel, got somebody slipping in my bed
She give me IQ, that mean she get a head
I just give the beats, so don't give a bread
'Cause we be in the club
Bottles on deck
And god dammit, god dammit
I'm feeling myself
'Cause I'mma get it all
And I'mma throw it up
Like god dammit, god dammit
I'm feeling myself
  Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'til we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
  (Whisper) Let me be your hero
Would you dance, if I asked you to dance?
Would you run, and never look back?
Would you cry, if you saw me crying?
Would you save my soul, tonight?
Would you tremble, if I touched your lips?
Would you laugh? Oh please tell me this
Now would you die, for the one you love?
Hold me in your arms, tonight
I can be your hero, Baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
Would you swear, that you'll always be mine?
Would you lie? Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
I don't care you're here, tonight
I can be your hero, Baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
Oh, I just wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you, Oh Yeah
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
Well I don't care you're here, tonight
I can be your hero, Baby
I can kiss away the pain (Oh Yeah)
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
I can be, your hero (I can be your hero, Baby)
I can kiss away the pain
And I will stand by you, forever
You can take my breath away
You can take my breath away
I can be your hero
  Uh-huh yeah
Woh-ho-ho-oh
  We're pilgrims on the journey
Of the narrow road
And those who've gone before us line the way
Cheering on the faithful, encouraging the weary
Their lives a stirring testament to God's sustaining grace
Surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses
Let us run the race not only for the prize
But as those who've gone before us
Let us leave to those behind us
The heritage of faithfulness passed on through godly lives
Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful
May the fire of our devotion light their way
May the footprints that we leave
Lead them to believe
And the lives we live inspire them to obey
Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful
After all our hopes and dreams have come and gone
And our children sift through all we've left behind
May the clues that they discover and the memories they uncover
Become the light that leads them to the road we each must find
Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful
Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful
  Sometimes out the blue life takes a turn
Unexpected and there's much to learn
Sittin the dark when it hits the lights
Hit's the fan and it hits the fam
Looking at my hands like here I am
How and why did we end up here
Close our eyes and we say a prayer like
I need help that can fly my way
I need an angel that can save me
I need a man with a bright red cape
Some people live and make it
other times we fall too hard
sometimes we gather the strength
to stand up and fight 'til we BEAT the odds!
I'm bullet proof, nothing to loose
fire away fire away
rickochet you take your aim
fire away fire away
you shoot me down
but I wont fall
I am titanium
you shoot me down
but I wont fall
I am titanium
It's kind of hard to get off the ground
Stuck in a place - no wings around
helpless - lost hope and health
didn't feel like you could carry yourself
found the strength to just carry on
found the words to write a new song
words can't express when you found you COULD
words can't express when you understood
that you can take your life and get second chance
look at your hands like here I am!
and now your troubles passed and you overcame
I'm bullet proof, nothing to loose
fire away fire away
rickochet you take your aim
fire away fire away
you shoot me down
but I wont fall
I am titanium
you shoot me down
but I wont fall
I am titanium
  When you're gone
I've been wondering around the house all night
Wondering what the hell to do
Yeah, I'm trying to concentrate but all I can think of is you
Well the phone don't ring 'cause my friends ain't home
Got the TV on 'cause the radio's playing
Baby when you're gone, I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on, and the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good, drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong, baby when you're gone
Yeah
I've been driving up and down these streets
Trying to find somewhere to go
Yeah I'm looking for a familiar face, but there's no one I know
Oh, this is torture, this is pain, it feels like I'm gonna go insane!
Baby when you're gone (when you're gone), I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on (on and on), and the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good, drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong (uh, yeah), baby when you're gone
Hey, don't go back, don't go
Don't go
Oh baby when you're gone (when you're gone)
I realize I'm in love (so in love)
The days go on and on and the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good (ahh ahh), drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong (so wrong), baby when you're gone
Yeah, gone
  Walking down the highway traffics coming my way
all I see are flashing lights
People wearing blue suits wanna know the real truth
how many did I have tonight?
Looking at the wreckage anyone would guess that all inside had died
But I'm alive
Wake up in a strange place angels over my head
one of them is shouting clear
1000 bolts of lightning bring me back to life
and it's a miracle that I'm still here
As I'm coming to life screaming out for you I need you by my side
Now I'm alive
No I didn't pray to God
No I never saw the light
No I didn't watch my life go flashing right before my eyes
No I didn't do the things that they all said that I would do
I just close my eyes and all I saw was you
All the things in my head everything left unsaid
I never got a second to say
Knew that I adored you the moment that I saw you
just terrified you'd push me away
Though we're dying slowly just want you to hold me what are we waiting for
We're alive
No I didn't pray to God
No I never saw the light
No I didn't watch my life go flashing right before my eyes
No I didn't do the things that they all said that I would do
I just close my eyes and all I saw was you
If I don't die lying in the rain and I live another day
then I'd run to you
Cos I don't have regrets just things I never say I need you
No I didn't pray to God
No I never saw the light
No I didn't watch my life go flashing right before my eyes
No I didn't do the things that they all said that I would do
I just close my eyes and all I saw was you
  Soul of Christ
Sanctify me
Body of Christ save me
Water from the side of Christ
Wash me, Passion of Christ
Give me strength
Hear me Jesus
Hide me in thy wounds
That I may never leave thy side
From all the evil that surrounds me
Defend me and when the call of death arrives
Bid me come to thee
That I may praise thee
With thy saints forever
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
Are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
There is no more sun,
There is no more moon,
Darkness of war has covered us,
And I wonder, my dear:
What will happen with us?
Sun is shining, sun is
No one knows, no one knows,
No one knows, no one knows,
No one knows what is it that)
  Yeah
Hum hum
C'mon c'mon
See
I sit down by the window and stare
The blind is shut but I don't care
I'm going up, i'm going down
I'm going nuts when you're not around
Don't you, paint a smile on me
Don't you, paint a smile on me
Don't you, paint a smile on me
Don't you, paint a smile on me
If you aren't gonna need me
Now, do i say
And when it's night say how'd you wanna go surfing
I'll say I stay and then I do some working
And when all is setting done
I can't do nothing when you're gone
Don't you, paint a smile on me
Don't you, paint a smile on me
Don't you, paint a smile on me
If you aren't gonna need me
Paint a smile on me, don't you
Paint a smile on me, don't you
Paint a smile on me, don't you
If you aren't gonna need me
The nights without you to hold me tight
These are nights where i can't feel right
Nine one o, nine o nine
I'm counting back till you say you're mine
Paint a smile on me, don't you
Paint a smile on me, don't you
Paint a smile on me, don't you
If you aren't gonna need me
Don't you, paint a smile on me
Don't you, paint a smile on me
Don't you, paint a smile on me
If you aren't gonna need me
  When He rolls up His sleeves
He ain't just putting on the ritz
Our God is an awesome God
There's thunder in His footsteps
And lightning in His fists
Our God is an awesome God
The Lord wasn't joking
When He kicked 'em out of Eden
And it wasn't for no reason
That He shed His blood
His return is very close
So you better be believing that
Our God is an awesome God
Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God
And when the sky was starless
In the void of the night
Our God is an awesome God
He spoke into the darkness
And created the light
Our God is an awesome God
Judgment and wrath
He poured out on the Sodom
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
I hope that you have not
Too quickly forgotten that
Our God is an awesome God
Our God is an awesome God (4x)
Vivo per lei da quando sai
la prima volta l'ho incontrata
non mi ricordo come ma
mi è entrata dentro e c'è restata
Vivo per lei perché mi fa
vibrare forte l'anima
vivo per lei e non è un peso
I have loved the same as you
One that I know will never leave me
It doesn't matter what I do
This time with her she won't deceit me
Thought I was asking far too much
Hoping to feel this magic touch,
E una musa che ci invita
Oh Nothing could be sweeter
atraverso un pianoforte
la morte è lontana
io vivo per lei
Now with my new love I can cope
With all that burs to know your softness
You are the one who give me hope
è un pugno che non fa mai male
Vivo per lei lo so mi fa
girare di città in città
soffrire un po' ma almeno io vivo
Now I hear the music playing
Vivo per lei dentro gli hotels
Something deep inside me saying
Vivo per lei nel vortice
  A hundred and five is the number
That comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do
And you know one of theses days
When I'll get my money right
Buy you everything and show you
All the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love
So there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough
I'll say will you marry me?
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me?
Singin whoa, whoa, oh, whoa, oh,
Oh yeah,
How many girls in the world can make me feel like this
Baby I don't ever plan to find out
The more I look the more I find the reasons why
You're the love of my life
And if I lose everything
In my heart it means no thing
Cause I have you, girl I have you
To get right down on bended knee
Nothing else would ever be better, better,
  We sing happy birthday to you,

This goes out to someone that was
Once the most important person in my life
I didn't realize it at the time
I can't forgive myself for the way I treated you so
I don't really expect you to either
Just listen,
You're the one that I want, the one that I need
The one that I gotta have just to succeed
When I first saw you, I knew it was real
I'm sorry about the pain I made you feel
That wasn't me; let me show you the way
I looked for the sun, but it's raining today
I remember when I first looked into your eyes
It was like God was there, heaven in the skies
I wore a disguise 'cause I didn't want to get hurt
But I didn't know I made everything worse
You told me we were crazy in love
But you didn't care when push came to shove
If you loved me as much as you said you did
Then you wouldn't have hurt me like I ain't shit
Now you pushed me away like you never even knew me
I loved you with my heart, really and truly
I guess you forgot about the times that we shared
When I would run my fingers through your hair
Late nights, just holding you in my arms
I don't know how I could do you so wrong
I really wanna show you I really need to hold you
I really wanna know you like no one else could know you
You're number one, always in my heart
And now I can't believe that our love is torn apart
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you 'cause
I wanna hold you,
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
I knew you gonna sit and play this with your new man
And then sit and laugh as you're holding his hand
The thought of that just shatters my heart
It breaks in my soul and it tears me apart
At times we was off I was scared to show you
Now I wanna hold you until I can't hold you
Without you, everything seems strange
Your name is forever planted in my brain
Damn it, I'm insane,
Take away the pain
Take away the hurt
Baby, we can make it work
What about when you
Looked into my eyes
Told me you loved me
As you would hugged me
I guess everything you said was a lie
I think about it, it brings tears to my eyes
Now I'm not even a thought in your mind
I can see clearly, my love is not blind
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you 'cause
I wanna hold you,
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
I just wish everything could have turned out differently
I had a special feeling about you
I thought maybe you did too
You would understand, but,
No matter what, you'll always be in my heart
You'll always be my baby
Our first day, it seemed so magical
I remember all the time that I had with you
Remember when you first came to my house?
You looked like an angel wearing that blouse
We hit it off, I knew it was real
But now I can't take all the pain that I feel
Reach in your heart, I know I'm still there
I don't wanna hear that you no longer care
Remember the times? Remember when we kissed?
I didn't think you would ever do me like this
I didn't think you'd wanna see me depressed
I thought you'd be there for me, this I confess
You said you were my best friend, was that a lie?
Now I'm nothing to you, you're with another guy
I tried, I tried, I tried, and I'm trying
Now on the inside it feels like I'm dying
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you 'cause
I wanna hold you,
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
And I do miss you
I just thought we were meant to be
I guess now, we'll never know
The only thing I want is for you to be happy
Whether it be with me, or without me
I just want you to be happy
  I didn't know how lost I was till I found you
Never knew what it meant to feel someone
Underneath an image of love I found you
At the unawareness of lust I found you
God I've been fearless how
Have I gone on all this time without you
I'll cross just cross
Rigid hills to be at your side again
I believe I'll be there to guide you when,
everything else around is caving in
Throughout rage and sunny weather and sin
Your love rocks
Your love rocks
Freedom suck
Freedom suck
I never knew how lost I was until I found you too
I realize it is your doing I feel well
Little woe is the seed you sow in here
I got voices saying you'll be fair in here
Saying how just how,
Have I gone on all this time without you
I'll cross, cross
Rigid hills to be at your side again
I believe I'll be there to guide you when
everything else around is caving in
Throughout rage and sunny weather and sin
Your love rocks
Your love rocks
Freedom suck
What you've given me lately,
is diamonds and good beats layed down softly upon me
Your love rocks
Yeah
Your love rocks
Freedom suck
What you've given me lately,
is diamonds and good beats layed down softly upon me
No not really, I never made plans really,
I never felt sincere this full really,
that you would come in this poise,
with this choice to choose with that much to lose in that voice really
waking dreams again
Your love rocks
Yeah
Your love rocks
Freedom suck
What you've given me lately,
is diamonds and good beats layed down softly upon me
Your love rocks
Yeah
Your love rocks
Freedom suck
What you've given me lately,
is diamonds and good beats layed down softly upon me
I believe I'll be there to guide you when,
everything else around is caving in
Throughout rage and sunny weather and sin
Throughout rage and sunny weather and sin
I believe
Oh
Oh!
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
And aim for my heart
If you feel like it
Take me away, and make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes, and I'll own you
With the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
Maybe it's hard
When you feel like
You're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car
We can ride it
Wherever you want
Get inside it
And you want to steer
But I'm shifting gear
I'll take it from here, oh, yeah, yeah
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes, and I'll own you
With the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
You wanna know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
So watch and learn
I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right
But if I share my secret
You gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes, and I'll own you
With the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
  Life will come our way
It has only just begun
The world will die alone
The frail will fall below
Time will take our place
We return it back to one
The calm before the cold
The long and lonely road
Look for the light that leads me home
Tired of feeling lost
Tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down
Tear the whole world down
Failure
Drive the cloud away
We will fall from last to none
The dark before the dawn
The war will carry on
Look for the light that leads me home
Tired of feeling lost
Tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down
Tear the whole world down
Tired of wasting breath
Tired of nothing left
Tear the whole world down
Tear the whole world down
Failure
Tired of feeling lost
Tiired of letting go
Tear the whole world down
Tear the whole world down
Tired of wasting breath
Tired of nothing left
Tear the whole world down
Tear the whole world down
We bury the sunlight
(Failure)
We bury the sunlight
(Failure)
Failure! Failure
We bury the sunlight
(Failure)
We bury the sunlight
(Failure)
Failure! Failure
Failure
  I've been running from it all my lifetime
There's nothing wrong with you, I'm searching for my right mind
Oh, you should've seen it they were resting on the restless
This happened, literally — woke up I was headless
I woke up I was headless
Aaaaaaaah

Waiting patiently was waiting taking up space
We are waiting taking up space

The earth below is above my feet when the clock is laughing at me
When copy cats and the lazy brats are the last thing I want to see
No, my enemy is a friend of mine in a friendly place to be seen
Hey, you know I'll run away for a couple years just to prove
I've never been free
They will never find me here!

Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
  Somewhere out there,
Beneath the pale moonlight,
Someone's thinking of me,
Somewhere out there,
Someone's saying a prayer,
That we'll find one another,
And even though I know how very far apart we are,
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star,
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby,
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky!
Somewhere out there,
If love can see us through,
Then we'll be together,
Somewhere out there,
Out where dreams
  Ifrån första början var jag säker
Jag kan göra vad som helst för dig i världen
Det har aldrig varit mer uppenbart, sen den dagen är det du och jag
Jag ska sluta åka taxi utan skyltar
Sluta leta efter kaos eller fylla
Jag ska lägga mig i tid för dig
Börja gå i terapi för dig
Hädanefter ska jag vara bra
Ska jag vara bra för dig
Hädanefter (hädanefter)
Hädanefter tänker jag efter
Jag ska vara bra för dig
Ska vara bra för dig
Jag vill inte glömma hur det kändes
Men jag orkar inte minnas allt som hände
Allt jag gjorde innan vi blev två
Jobbar jag för att bli bättre på
Vad du än kan tänkas göra som är dåligt
Kan det aldrig vara oförlåtligt
Du kan skrika eller hata mig
Tänker ändå alltid välja dig
Hädanefter ska jag vara bra
Ska jag vara bra för dig
Hädanefter (hädanefter)
Hädanefter tänker jag efter
Jag ska vara bra för dig
Ska vara bra för dig
Vi var stökiga och stöddiga
Jag var nästan inte dödlig
Alla andra var så prydliga
Jag kommer kanske se tillbaks nån dag
När allt det är förlåtet
Hädanefter ska jag vara bra
Hädanefter ska jag vara bra
Ska jag vara bra för dig
Hädanefter (hädanefter)
Hädanefter tänker jag efter
Jag ska vara bra för dig
Ska vara bra för dig
  I've been banned from every racecourse in the country
There's something about the unsure thing
Like scoring with a beauty of the county
It always makes the old bell ring
I like to go for broke and I'll be randy
It's got to be the unsure thing
In the Bentley Continental with the brandy
It always makes the old bell ring
And when it's gone, all gone
I'll stand on a hilltop and sing
I go where I want, I do what I want
And I don't give a damn about a thing
Skydiver
Today I lost a packet at Wincanton
All on the nose and no-one counting
Nothing wishy-washy in between
Back when I made the pivotal decision
To take a winding road that I could see
It was just like being given an incredible permission
The rules don't apply to me
And when it's gone, all gone
I'll stand on a hilltop and sing
I go where I want, I do what I want
And I don't give a damn about a thing
Skydiver
I'm not being brave, it's my money, not my life
When I need to take a break from the brushes and the knife
And I always took a fancy to the ones
Heading straight into the teeth of the guns
Skydiver
  Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting, no fighting
We got the refugees up in here
No fighting, no fighting
Shakira, Shakira
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Shakira, Shakira
Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body
And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, si, es perfecto
Hey Girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing
And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Shakira, Shakira
Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body
And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I am starting to feel you boy
Come on lets go, real slow
Don't you see baby asi es perfecto
Oh I know I am on tonight my hips don't lie
And I am starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, si, es perfecto
Shakira, Shakira
Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de dia
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de dia
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Shakira, Shakira
Oh baby when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body
Senorita, feel the conga, let me see you move
like you come from Colombia
She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee
like me back with the Fugees from a 3rd world country
I go back like when 'pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
I need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats
I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto
Oh, you know I am on tonight and my hips don't lie
And I am starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection
No fighting
No fighting
It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way, from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew all the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
About another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it would'nt last
Had to switch up, look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays
Now I'll see you in a better place
How could we not talk about feelings when feelings all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way, from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
First you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turns to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broke, and the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached so remember me when I'm gone!
How could we not talk about feelings, when feelings all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way
yeah, hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home
It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way, from where we began
Oh i'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
  di mangangamba sa kawalan
pagpapala mo'y laging laan
di matatakot sa panganib
'pagkat naririyan ka palagi
'di matitinag sa pagsubok
ang pagsama mo'y tiyak at lubos
'di mapipigil sa pag-awit
'pagkat ikaw ay mabuti
'pagkat ikaw ay mabuti
ikaw ang aking pastol hindi magkukulang
sapat na at higit pa
biyaya mo'y sagana at umaapaw
sapat na at higit pa
sapat na sa lahat kong pangangailangan
higit pa sa lahat kong inaasahan
wala na ngang mahihiling pa
'pagkat ika'y sapat na
ika'y sapat na at higit pa
  Du går med blicken vänd
kan du ha sett mig än
Någon borde byta stad
för nu kommer allt tillbaks
vårt födelsedagshotell
en vanlig Skanstullskväll
Jag minns bara allt det bra
allt som var du och jag
men aldrig, aldrig
kommer allt tillbaks
aldrig, aldrig
allt som var du och jag
aldrig, aldrig
kommer allt tillbaks
aldrig, aldrig
men jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du gjort
Du kan gråta mitt på gatan
men jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du gjort
Du får passa dig som satan
för jag glömmer aldrig bort vart du bor
men jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du gjort
nej jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du gjort
nej, nej
jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du gjort
I samma låga skor
och leendet du log
Såhär kan det inte va
Såhär kan det inte va
Bjuder på cigg igen
men nu så fienden
Säger att allt är bra
Hur fan kan du spela glad
Aldrig, aldrig
inte en enda dag
Aldrig, aldrig
inte en enda dag
Du kan gråta mitt på gatan
men jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du gjort
Du får passa dig som satan
för jag glömmer aldrig bort vart du bor
Du kan gråta mitt på gatan
men jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du gjort
nej jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du gjort
nej jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du gjort
nej, nej
Gick omkring i ditt kvarter tills det blev för kallt
tänkte ut en dialog mellan oss och allt
lampan släcktes i din hall och jag gick hem igen
för har inte glömt vad du, har inte glömt vad du gjort
vad du gjort
Du kan gråta mitt på gatan
men jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du gjort
Du får passa dig som satan
men jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du
aldrig bort vad du gjort
aldrig bort vad du gjort
vad du gjort
nej jag glömmer aldrig bort vad du gjort
  Vad jag bryr mig om nu
är att du kommer nära mig
även om det är försent att älska dig
Vad jag bryr mig om nu
är att från samma säng
lyssna till samma regn
Vad jag bryr mig om nu
är att få ut dig ur skallen
är att aldrig ge hela hjärtat för kärlek igen
den tar slut från kyss till tschüss
Vad jag bryr mig om nu
är att aldrig ge hjärtat rakt ut
Vad jag bryr mig om nu
är att du ligger vaken
i morgontimmen när regnet slår mot fönstret
och det låter som om det går på dig
Vad jag bryr mig om nu
är att du då ser det
hur smutsigt livet blivit
Och vad jag bryr mig om nu
är att se din blick så sårad
när alla löften klingar falskt
nästa gång du lovar någon allt
Vad jag bryr mig om nu
i dina armar om mig
även om jag vet att jag måste glömma dig
Vad jag bryr mig om är att se dig gråta
för jag har gråtit
och du ringde aldrig
Vad jag bryr mig om är att du kallar på mig
även om jag inte kommer tillbaks till dig
Vad jag bryr mig om är att se som i slow-motion
när du går sönder inuti
så som jag gjorde nyss
Vad jag bryr mig om är att du kallar på mig
även om jag inte kommer tillbaka till dig
Vad jag bryr mig om
är att höra dig andas
veta att du är nära
förlåt, nu slutar jag
Vad jag bryr mig om är att du kallar på mig
även om inte kommer tillbaks till dig
säg nånting
säg nånting
Vad jag bryr mig är att du kallar på mig
även om jag inte kommer tillbaks till dig
Vad jag bryr mig är att du kallar på mig
även om jag inte kommer tillbaks till dig
Vad jag bryr mig är att du kallar på mig
  My life is brilliant
My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel
With a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you
  Home, It's becoming a killing field
There's a cross hair locked on my heart
With no recourse and there's no one behind the wheel
Hellfire, you're walking in the crossfire
Drones (killed by)
Drones (killed by)
You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
You've got the CIA baby
All you've done is brutalize
Drones!
War, war just moved up a gear
I don't think I can handle the truth
I'm just a pawn
And we're all expendable
Incidentally
Electronically erased
By your
Drones (killed by)
Drones (killed by)
You kill by remote control
And the world is on your side
You've got reapers and hawks babe
Now I am radicalized
Drones!
You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
You've got the CIA baby
All you've done is brutalize
You kill by remote control
And the world is on your side
You've got reapers and hawks babe
Now I am radicalized
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!
  Seems like dreams like I always had
Could be, should be making me glad
Why am I blue?
It's up to you to explain
I'm thinking maybe, baby, I'll go away
Someday, some way, you'll come and say
It's you I need and you'll be pleading in vain
It had to be you, just had to be you
I wandered around, finally found somebody who
Could make me be true
Or could make me be blue
Or even be glad, just to be sad
Thinking of you
Some others I've seen
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Marvelous you
It had to be you
Alright let's go
Ok!
It had to be you
Well some call it fate
It had to be you
I just have to wait
We wandered around, finally found somebody who

You could run the mile
You could walk straight through hell with a smile

Breaking all the records that thought never could be broke

Never gonna know if you never even try
Do it for your country
Do it for you name

When your, standing in the hall of fame

How long will I love you
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I can
How long will I need you
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan
How long will I be with you
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash upon the sand
How long will I want you
As long as you want me to
And longer by far
How long will I hold you
As long as your father told you
As long as you can
How long will I give to you
As long as I live through you
However long you stay
How long will I love you
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I may
(Hmm)
How long will I love you
As long as stars are above you
  Near Banbridge town, in the County Down
One evening last July
Down a bóithrín green came a sweet cailín
She looked so neat in her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut-brown hair
Such a coaxing elf, I'd to shake myself
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay
From Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
And I gazed with a feeling queer
And I said, says I, to a passerby
"Who's your one with the nut-brown hair?"
He smiled at me, and with pride says he,
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay
From Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
She'd a soft brown eye and
a look so sly and a smile like the rose in June
And you held each note from her auburn throat,
as she lilted lamenting tunes
At the pattern dance you'd be in trance
as she skipped through a jig or reel
When her eyes she'd roll, as she'd lift soul
And your heart she would likely steal
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay
From Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
At the harvest fair she'll be surely there
and I'll dress my Sunday clothes
With my hat cocked right and my shoes shon bright
for a smile from the nut-brown Rose
No horse I'll yoke, or pipe I smoke,
'til the rust in my plough turn brown
And a smiling bride by my own fireside
sits the star of the County Down
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay
From Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
She'd a soft brown eye and
a look so sly and a smile like the rose in June
And you held each note from her auburn throat,
as she lilted lamenting tunes
At the pattern dance you'd be in trance
as she skipped through a jig or reel
When her eyes she'd roll, as she'd lift soul
And your heart she would likely steal
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay

Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say
Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
To my friends in New York, I say hello
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Col-or-ado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can' t jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We've all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there is to complain about
When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in
Hopelessly
I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly
I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly
I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cuz hopelessly
The hope is we have so much to feel good about

Sometimes people leave you
LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
CINDERELLA(To Little Red)
Who knows what she'd say?
Who can say what's true?
Nothing's quite so clear now-
Feel you've lost your way?
You decide, but
No one is alone,
BOTH
You move just a finger,
Say the slightest word,
Something's bound to linger,
CINDERELLA
Fathers,
Mothers,
BOTH
People make mistakes,
Holding their own,
CINDERELLA
Fight for their mistakes-
Everybody makes-
BOTH
One another's
Witches can be right,
You decide what's right,
CINDERELLA
Just remember:
BAKER
Just remember:
BOTH

Fold up your wings close your eyes

Girl you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see
We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye
Well, I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go,
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Girl, I know you really love me,
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever, you and I
Can you love me again like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go,
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
(spoken)
Girl I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just run out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat at night
Just like you did baby but that's all right
Huh, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
because you just won't come back to me
Will you, just come back to me
(Lonely)
Yes baby my heart is lonely
(Lonely)
My heart hurts baby
(Lonely)
I feel pain too
Baby please
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go,
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Although we've come to the end of the road
(music starts to fade out)
Still I can't let go,
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

I know you've been goin' through some things, uh huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drinking Hen' and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been
Dancin', dancin' dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop pop pop like Pepsi Coke, the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get
Bustin' wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes that y'all don't speak the same language
I know that you just wanna let it go
With all the bitches that you came with
I know you've been going through some thangs, wanna get away
Baby let me be your vacation
That other chick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin'
Baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card oh God I think I got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space
We can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas?
South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing
But no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
(I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
Which your may think that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain)
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
(Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you runnin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know it look like like you need a vacation
How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia
Take you places 'lotta niggas can't take ya
Don't forget the make up
Yeah
  I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turnin' green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream
Oh, ooo, ooo, ooo
Oh, ohh, and they come unstuck
Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat, 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's runnin' from himself
She's been livin' on the highest shelf
Oh, ooo, ooo, ooo
Oh, ohh, and they come unstuck
Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat, 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it in any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat, 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat, 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat, 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong, and
I got a lump in my throat, 'cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
  When did we lose our way?
Easier to let it go
So many can't tell anybody
How did I let you know?
Call me when you made up your mind but you won't
Caught up in a way that you paint my heart
Only love could ever heal this hurt
Oh don't be scared about it
Do you forgive my spill?
Do you remember the way it made you feel?
Do you remember the things it let you feel?
How do I make you stay
When it's easier let you go?
Nobody knows what we know about it
No one needs to know
Call me when you made up your mind but you won't
Caught up in a way that you paint my heart
Only love could ever heal this hurt
Oh don't be scared about it
Do you forgive my spill?
Do you remember the way it made you feel?
Do you remember the things it let you feel?
When you lied to your limit
You gave all your given
Who you gonna pray to when your there?
Will you find out that there ain't no other love?
No other love for you?
Oh don't be scared about it
Do you forgive my spill?
Do you remember the way it made you feel?
Do you remember the things it let you feel?
Oh when you think about it?
Do you remember me?
Do you remember the way it made you feel?
Do you remember the things it let you feel?
  Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standing out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Yeah, the a taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me
Anyone in between is the enemy
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from
Love was something you've never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping, baby by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Try to find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me now, tell me now,
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid?
Tell me now, tell me now,
Tell me will you ever love me again, love me again?
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping, baby, by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Try to find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me where you're hiding out
Where do broken hearts go?
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me, 'cause I'm ten feet down
Where do broken hearts go?
Come on, baby, come and get me out
Come on, baby, come and get me out
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

In the club and a nigga get it boppin'

(How much, how much you made)
Made some million dollars of a mixtape and I fuck like ooohhh
Aye, get at me
  On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle
Ad she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
Please bring me my wine
He said 'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
'Relax', said the night man
We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like
But you can never leave
  What an amazing time
What a family
How did the years go by
Now it's only me
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
La, la, la, la, la, la, la (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Like a cat in heat, stuck in a moving car
A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake
What if they say that you're a cloner
Naturally, I'm worried if I do it alone
Who really cares, cause it's your life
You never know, it could be great
Take a chance cause you might grow
Oh, ah, oh
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Take a chance you stupid hoe
Like an echo pedal, you're repeating yourself
You know it all by heart
Why are you standing in one place
Born to blossom, bloom to perish
Your moment will run out
Cause of your sex chromosome
I know it's so messed up, how our society all thinks (for sure)
Life is short, you're capable
Oh, ah, oh
(Uh-huh, hu-huh)
Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million-dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for
I can't wait to go back and do Japan
Get me lots of brand new fans
Osaka, Tokyo
You Harajuku girls
Damn, you've got some wicked style
Go
Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for
What you waiting for
What you waiting for
Take a chance you stupid hoe (what you waiting for?)
Take a chance you stupid hoe
What you waiting for
What you waiting for
Take a chance you stupid hoe (what you waiting for?)
Take a chance you stupid hoe

  I like to ate ate ate apples and bananas
I like eat eat eat epples and benenes
I like to ite ite ite ipples and bininis
I like to ote ote ote oplles and bononos
I like to ute ute ute upples and bununus
But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be-
If I loved you
Time and time again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know
If I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go
Longin' to tell you
But afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by
Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know how I loved you
If I loved you
That's what you said, isn't it?
Yes!
I can smell 'em, can you, ah
You can't hear a sound, not the turn of a leaf
Nor the fall of a wave hittin' the sand
The tide's creepin up on the beach like a thief
Afraid to be caught stealin the land
On a night like this I start to wonder
What life is all about
And I always say two heads are better than one to
Figure it out
I don't need you, and don't need anybody helpin' me
Well, I got it figured out for myself
A couple of specks o' nuthin'
There's a hell of a lotta stars in the sky
And the sky's so big the sea looks small
And two little people, you and I
We don't count at all
You're a funny kid, you know?
Hey, you're trying to get me to marry you?
No!
Then what's puttin into my head baby?
You have doped me with that little kid's face, right?
You've adjusted me
What?
Nothin
No, I know what it'd be like
It'd be awful! I can just see myself-
Kinda scrawny and pale
Pickin at my food
And love sick like any other guy
I'd throw away my sweater and dress up like a dude
In a dicky and a collar and a tie
If I loved you
But you don't
No, I don't!
But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be
If I loved you
Time and time again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know
If I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go
Longin to tell you
But afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by
Soon you'd leave me
Off you'd go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I loved you
If I loved you
No, even if a girl was foolish enough to want me to
I wouldn't!
Don't worry about it, Billy
Who's worried?
You're right about there bein' no wind
The blossoms are comin down by themselves
  (instrumental)
I'm scared
So afraid to show I care
Will he think me weak
If I tremble when I speak
Oooh
What if
There's another one he's thinking of
Maybe he's in love
I'd feel like a fool
Life can be so cruel
I don't know what to do
I've been there
With my heart out in my hand
But what you must understand
You can't let the chance
To love him pass you by
Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself
Touch him
Oooh
With the gentleness you feel inside
I feel it
Your love can't be denied
The truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be
All in time you'll see
Oooh
I love him
Then show him
Of that much I can be sure
Hold him close to you
I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say
Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself
Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Your faith will lead love where it has to go
Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Whisper words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself
Oooh
  Hon låg på gatan
medan rymdskeppen
sände meddelanden
genom atmosfären
Hon skär sig i handleden
i solskenet
för hon säger
att hon redan sett Spanien
och världen förtjänar inte dig
För du är det finaste jag vet
när allt annat här
är falskt och fel
och jag går bara ner mig
för det är så jag säger det
du är det finaste jag vet
Det kan ta slut i morgon
eller hålla på för alltid
ibland är det så
Så säg som det är
för den här gången
krävs det mer
innan jag öppnar armarna
förlorar mig
och känslorna faller fritt
på midnattsgatorna
för vem skulle bry sig
om våra hjärtan blev förstörda?
Men allt det här vänder sig
in i mig
Och du är det finaste jag vet
när allt annat här
är falskt och fel
och jag går bara ner mig
för det är så jag säger det
du är det finaste jag vet
När jag tänkte på dig,
kände du mig?
genom antennerna
och sateliterna
När du låg på gatan
medan rymdskeppen
sände meddelanden
genom atmosfären
och världen förtjänar inte dig
För du är det finaste jag vet
när allt annat är falskt och fel
och jag bara går ner mig
för det är så jag säger det
till dig
- du är det finaste jag vet
Allt roligt börjar
och slutar med
att vi är nere och ute igen
(men vad behöver vi
egentligen?)
Jag vänder mig om,
hon bara ler
allén är inte så dålig ändå
när du går brevid
Moscow, your golden towers glow,
And every night, night, night there is music
Oh every night, night, night there is love,

{fade}
  When the word weigh heavy on the heart
I am lost and lead only by the stars
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chasing me, I'm thrown
Breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
Breathe in, breathe out
And let it in
Once awoke, it will slowly crawl
Beneath the skin
So breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
The womb is still shadows form a grill
If I lose control I feed the beast within
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chasing me, I'm thrown
Breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
Breathe in, breathe out
And let it in
Once awoke, it will slowly crawl
Beneath the skin
So breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chasing me, I'm thrown
If I could only let go
  There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space, make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world, make a better world
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
And the dream we would conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify it's soul
Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly
Be God's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel
You all are my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn
Their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space to make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
You and for me / Make a better place
You and for me / Make a better place
You and for me / Make a better place
You and for me / Heal the world we live in
You and for me / Save it for our children
You and for me / Heal the world we live in
You and for me / Save it for our children
You and for me / Heal the world we live in
You and for me / Save it for our children
You and for me / Heal the world we live in
You and for me / Save it for our children
  Honey, I'm telling the truth
I did something terrible in my early youth
My mind went blank, I lost control
I was just a little boy, I did not know
I better let you go
To find the prince you thought you found in me
I better set you free and give you up
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live
Without a monster like me
Honey, what am I to you?
I have pulled the trigger on this awful truth
Oh, hold me now 'cause I'm burning up
Sing me something beautiful, just make it stop
I better let you go
To find the prince you thought you found in me
I better set you free and give you up
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live
Without a monster like me
Oh, oh,
Oh, oh,
Just go
To find the prince you thought you found in me
I better set you free and give you up
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live
Without a monster like me, oh
Without a monster like me
Lorde meet King Push
Life is like a costume party
Just cover the floors in Cavalli
Let's hide the hurt in a molly
We're all tryna be somebody else
You can't hide your tears in wealth
When your heart knows you hate yourself
It's all pain we felt
Just the way that the card's been dealt
Velvet rope, let us pass
Drop an olive in your glass
Put it on, a disguise
It's an opera of lies
Everyone on the run
Fifty feet all on the gas
Take him out, take him out
Gonna take him out
We're the only theory they can't prove
And we don't have anything to lose
In my eyes, in my ears
Bring might
Love is only figured once in life
Tell the crowd, search the town
And we made it all meltdown
It's a full meltdown
Try to break her spirit so it shouldn't be surprisin'
We're here with no fear and gave her uprising
Gonna blend in with the bullies and the bureaucrats
Arrows pierce like lightning, choppers sound like thunder clap
Never will you stand, we gon' lay you down
Debonair and dapper kids comin' in to take the town
Try to restrain us, even though you trained us
We're better than you are, now we're gonna make you feed us
We're all lookin' for status
Cristal sent over on gratis
Can't pretend we're not plastic
When these poker faces take practice
Who to trust? Who to love?
Who to run from? Who to hug?
Set fire to a government of thugs
Respect only comes from the money or your blood
We're out of sight, shadows of light
They're closing in and I know where we're goin'
But I don't know who I'll be
(I can hear, and see a ghost)
Was it meant to be?
(In my mind, I know)
Cause I can't see
(And if you keep acting up)
I can't see
(I'm your undertow)
  The garden was blessed by the gods of me and you
So we headed west to find ourselves some truth
what you waiting for?
what you waiting for?
We counted all our reasons, excuses that we made
We found ourselves some treasure then threw it all away
What you waiting for? (x3)
When I dance alone and the sun's beating down,
blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused, blame it on me
What you waiting for?
what you waiting for?
Caught in the tide of blossom, caught in the carnival
Your confidence forgotten, I see the gypsies roll,
What you waiting for? (x3)
When I dance alone and the sun's beating down,
blame it on me,
When I lose control and the veil's overused, blame it on me
What you waiting for? (x3)
When I dance alone and the sun's beating down,
blame it on me,
When I lose control and the veil's overused, blame it on me
When I dance alone I know, I'll go, blame it on me
When I lose control I know, I'll go, blame it on me
What you waiting for? (x3)

Something 'bout us
Doesn't seem right these days
Life keeps getting in the way
Whenever we try somehow the plan
Is always rearranged
It's so hard to say
But I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way (My own way)
Don't wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up
And I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to grey
And it's just too hard to watch it all
Slowly fade away
I'm leaving today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
What about us?
What about everything we've been through?
And what about trust?
You know I never wanted to hurt you
And what about me?
What am I supposed to do?
I gotta leave but
I'll miss you
Ooh-Ooh, Oh-Oh So
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here (Why do you have to go?)
I hope you understand (I'm trying to understand)
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now (I want you to stay)
I gotta go my own way
I've got to move on and be who I am (What about us?)
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand (I'm trying to understand)
We might find our place in this world someday (World someday)
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way

  Boy the way Glenn Miller Played
Songs that made the Hit Parade
Guys like us we had it made
Didn't need no Welfare states
Everybody pulled his weight
gee our old LaSalle ran great
Those were the days
And you knew who you were then
Girls were girls and men were men
Mister, we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again
People seemd to be content
$50 payed the rent
Freaks were in a circus tent
Those were the days
Take a little sunday spin
Tonight I'll watch the dogers win
Have yourself a dandy day that cost you under a fin
Hair was short and skirts were long
Kate Smith really sung the song
I don't know just what went wrong
THOSE WERE THE DAYS!
You requested it so we rewound
I got enemies, I got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga
I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin' online that ain't part of my day
I real shit poppin' with my family too
I got niggas that can never leave Canada too
I got 2 mortgages, thirty million in total
I got niggas that'll still try fuckin' me over
I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
But my actin' days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yea
I got people talkin' down, man, like I give a fuck
I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck
I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall
I keep buyin' shit just make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches askin' me about the code for the wifi
So they can talk about they timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friends
Ex-girl she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I heard everybody talkin bout what they gonna be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see
I got money in the courts so all my niggas are free
Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
Well run up when you see me, then we gon' see
Naw, fuck all of you niggas I ain't finished
Y'all don't wanna hear me say it's a goal
Y'all don't wanna see Wayne win fifty awards
I got real ones livin' past Kennedy Road
I got real ones with me everywhere that I go
I'm tryna tell ya, I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
Every time I see 'em somethin' wrong with they memory
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
So tired of savin' all these niggas, mayne!
  Ain't this what you came for
Don't you wish you came more, oh
Girl what you're playing for
Come on, let me fix that
Ooh, I know you miss that
What's wrong, let me kiss that
Twist that
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight i'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but i'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but i'll be
The best you ever had
I hit you with the best stroke,
Freestly in the breast stroke
Til you blowing cigarette smoke
And now the bed's broke
So what we gon' do now
F-ck it, round two now
Work it out, then we cool down
Cool down
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight i'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but i'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but i'll be
The best you ever had
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowin' me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot,
I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich n-gga bread, stay poppin' like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella, we'll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm, s-x in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the thriller in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Than throw you on a grill
Cause seven days a week you're my 5 course meal
For real!
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight i'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but i'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but i'll be
The best you ever had
me (dance with me)
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do
I will want nothing else to see me through
If I can spend my lifetime loving you
Though we know we will never come again
Where there is love, life begins
Over and over again
Save the night, save the day,
Save the love, come what may,
Love is worth everything we pay
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do
I will want nothing else to see me through
If I can spend my lifetime loving you
  When I was a boy
I dreamed of a place in the sky
Playing in the fields
Battling with my shields
Bows made out of twine
I wish I could see this world again
Through those eyes
See the child in me
In my fantasy
Never growing old
Will we ever feel young again
Will we ever feel young again
Will we ever feel young again
We want to feel young
We want to feel young again
I searched for a world that's unknown
All we have is fun
Everybody run
Until the sun goes down
I wish I could see this world again
Through those eyes
See the child in me
In my fantasy
Never growing old
Will we ever feel again
Will we ever feel again
Will we ever feel again
We want to feel young
We want to feel young again﻿
  No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do – I wonder why
You have to go out of my door
And leave just like you did before
I know I said that I was sure
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think of all the stories that we could have told
Little me and little you
Kept doing all the things they do
They never really think it through
Like I can never think you're true
Here I go again – the blame
The guilt, the pain, the hurt, the shame
The founding fathers of our plane
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
  well the first time that i saw her
standing in the middle of the road
eyes as bright as christmas lights
wearing someone else's clothes
i did my best to ignore her
but ignoring my best pretty soon
we spent the night all tangled tight
in an armchair in my friends front room
i said darling you know
darling you know i can't stay
cos i've given my heart and my word to a girl far away
i felt week as she kissed my cheek
and sighed when i heard her say
never knew i could get my heart broken in less than a day
oh and the next time that i saw her
must have been a year or more
face stained with mascara
shivering outside my door
i did my best to assure her
but assurance isn't easy to give
if you've never been sure of anything much
and get less so the longer you live
she said darling you know
darling you know i can't stay
cos i've given my heart and my word to a boy far away
i spoke soft and pretended to cough
like i didn't care either way
never knew i could get my heart broken in so many ways
and the last time i saw her
standing in the pouring rain
hair a little shorter
but everything else looked the same
i could've told her that i adored her
she could've said she felt the same way
but we just smiled cos sometimes words
aren't the right words to say
we just smiled cos sometimes words
aren't the right words to say
  Poses, poses
That's all you are to me
Roses, roses
That's all you're offering me
And now I wish to God that
The earth would turn cold
And my heart would forget it's made of glass
And all the pretty tulips would disappear
And never disturb me again
You gave me my very first gun
I'll go out and hunt the hidden dome
With white foxes, with white foxes
Freeze
Hunger, hunger is the purest sin
It is empty church in a crowded bin
I've wept and I've stumbled
I fought and I craved
For the gravy of your soul
But all I want to do now is walk along
Down barren trees in fields of snow
You gave me my very first gun
I'll go out and hunt the hidden dome
With white foxes, with white foxes
Freeze, freeze
My eye is my sanctuary
  As long as you love me
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me, MMM-MMM-MMM
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be
I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't know)
Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (Yeah-Eh-Eh)
As long as you love me
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows, when you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're coming from (I don't care)
As long as you love me, Baby, Hoo-Hoo, Hoo-Ooh, Ooh
I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (You love me)
Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
Don't care what you did (Yeah-Eh-Eh)
As long as you love me (You love me)
Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love me
  Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
(Whistle)
Always look on the light side
(Whistle)
If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle
(Whistle)
Always look on the right side
(Whistle)
For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain
with a bow
Forget about your sin - give the
audience a grin
Enjoy it - it's your last chance
So always look on the bright side
(Whistle)
(Whistle)
Life's a piece of shit, when you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see its all a show, keep 'em laughin as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
Always look on the bright side
(Whistle)
Always look on the right side
C'mon Brian, cheer up
Always look on the bright side
Always look on the bright side
I mean - what have you got to lose?
You know, you come from nothing
Always look on the right side
what have you got to lose?
You know, you come from nothing
What have you lost?
Nothing will come from nothing ya know what they say?
Cheer up ya old bugga c'mon give us a grin!
There ya go, see!
(Cheer up ya old bugga c'mon give us a grin! At same time)
There ya go, see!
I've got a special power
that I'm not afraid to use
Come on, this is my adventure
this is my fantasy,
it's all about living in the ocean,
being wild and free
'Cause I'm no ordinary girl
I'm from the deep blue underworld,
land or sea
I've got the power if I just believe
'Cause I'm no ordinary girl
I'm from the deep blue underworld,
land or sea the world's my oyster, I'm the pearl
no ordinary girl
We gotta stick together
'Cause the best things come in three
I want it to last for ever
All the magic and fun at sea
so come on this is our adventure
There's no telling where we'll go
All I want is just to live amongst the H2O
Come along it just gets better
So much to do in just so little time
because it all depends on whether
you want to leave the land and thoughts behind!
A shot in the dark
A past, lost in space
Where do I start
The past and the chase
You hunted me down
Like a wolf, a predator
I felt like deer in love lights
You loved me, and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete
With a she-wolf who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes
Cause I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Did she lie in wait
Was I bait to pull you in
The thrill of the kill
You feel is a sin
Lay with the wolves
Alone it seems
I thought I was part of you
You love me, and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete
With a she-wolf who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes
Cause I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
I love you like chisel and stone
I love you like needle and bone
I love you like a god loves his son
And I love you like my hand on a gun
I go bang, bang, bang, a-bang, bang, bang
That's how I love, love, love, love, love you
I love you
This one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
Where are right where we should be
With my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wannna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Poppin shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell em shove it
Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster, lacklustered
Cuz he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass skuzzes, f-ck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
As if this aint some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade through a haters rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let em Bics raise cause I came with 5'9′ but I feel like I'm 6'8″
This one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
Where are right where we should be
With my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wannna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron
to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin to blow it
And I aint gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write till he can march right
into that post office and tell em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meooww, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
Ya'll are doomed
I remember when T-Pain aint wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes
Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal
and now I'm the second best I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight we're alright
So hold up your light
Let it shine
Cuz this one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
Where are right where we should be
With my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wannna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters
Baby let me put your panties to the side
I'ma make you feel alright
'Cause I'ma give you what you need, yeah
Mami you remind me of something
I don't know what it is
You remind me of something
You gotta show me
Alright, you remind me of something
I don't know what it is right now
You remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me
Uh, on the real no lie
I don't know what it is but you just my type
Everything just right
B set put us to the left
Don't listen to the hype though
Got a cup in your hand
Baby sitting but you ain't got no kids
We ain't leaving 'til there ain't no more left
Can't see no time on the Rolex
I could tell you a freak, go and show it
Looking for the after party, where to go at?
Go on the floor like a doormat
Baby you know where to throw that
I said
Mami you remind me of something
I don't know what it is
You remind me of something
You gotta show me
Alright, you remind me of something
I don't know what it is right now
You remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me
Baby if you know what it is
On the real, can't lie, man just my type
Hands in the air looking for bitch right now
On the real, can't lie, man just my type
Uh, so tell me what your name is
I don't really care who you came with
Unless you got a couple friends look like you
My bad if my ex try to fight you
Roll up soon as I roll in
Security better get with the program
Too deep, ain't know where to stand
So high, ain't know where to land
You remind me of something missing
Misses, you got my full attention
Listen, let go of the tension
If I get a minute, I put your bad ass in detention
Oh baby show me, show me something
Tomorrow I might be hungover, that don't mean nothing
See you all night long, I've been wrong
Baby show me something
You let me do it
  If you wanna be somebody
If you wanna go somewhere,
(heeey)
So you think you've got the anwsers
Well in my mind I thought the same one time
But attitude will catch up with you,
If you wanna be somebody
If you wanna go somewhere,
When the time is now or never
to make your dreams come true,
I ain't buying no more lying
cause truth don't cost a thing
It's by sweatin' without stressin',
If you wanna be somebody (be somebody)
If you wanna go somewhere,
The time is now or never
to make your dreams come true,
If you wanna be somebody(be somebody)
If you wanna go somewhere(go somewhere)
you better wake up and pay attention(wake up and pay attention)
When the time is now or never
to make your dreams come true,
Time to wake up everybody,
If you wanna be somebody(be somebody)
If you wanna go somewhere(go somewhere)
you better wake up and pay attention( pay attention)
When the time is now or never
to make your dreams come true,
If you wanna be somebody(wake up)
The time is now or never,
If you wanna be somebody(wake up)
The time is now or never,
  It's time to invade
The Bay of Pigs
They're out for blood tonight they're the widowmakers
Killer elite Cuba invaders
A motley crew in the line of fire
A raging horde of criminal pilgrims
Murder patrol of heavy drug addicts
Burning wheel on the road to ruin
This is the dark chapter of freedom
But no one cares where is the reader now
The words are gone somehow but I just can't take it so
Break the chains one final time
We'll see you on the other side
The revolution's bound to fail
And God is on your side
They aimed to take the residence
But left by their own president
Failure is what people say
About the Bay of Pigs
So have you seen the news have you felt desire
The lust to kill to turn on the pyre
Tell me son: Do you even bother
Sometimes it drives me mad that I don't know
The secret script to the questions of our lives
Please don't say that I am a liar
You know
Back in the days they remembered the world war
It was for real and just like a time bomb
Why can't we find another way these boys were on top so
Break the chains one final time
We'll see you on the other side
The revolution's bound to fail
And God is on your side
They aimed to take the residence
But left by their own president
Failure is what people say
About the Bay of Pigs
What a slaughter
This is the dark side of the story
Ooohh
Let's find another war
You better break the chains one final time
We'll see you on the other side
The revolution's bound to fail
And God is on your side
They aimed to take the residence
But left by their own president
Failure is what people say
About the Bay of Pigs
The Bay of Pigs
The Bay of Pigs
The Bay of Pigs
  When you walk into the room
Everything changes
Darkness starts to tremble
At the light that you bring
And when you walk into the room
Every heart starts burning
And nothing matters more
Than just to sit here at your feet
And worship you
We worship you
We love you
We'll never stop
We can't live without you, Jesus
We love you
And we can't get enough
All this is for you, Jesus
When you walk into the room
Sickness starts to vanish
Every hopeless situation ceases to exist
And when you walk into the room,
The dead begin to rise
'Cause there is resurrection life
In all You do
Come and consume, God
All we are
We give you permission
Our hearts are Yours
We want You
We want You
  I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense is controlling my mind
I cannot find the way out of here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
  And that's why birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it - think of Siamese twins
Some Argentines, without means, do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Romantic sponges, they say, do it
Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Cold Cape Cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish, do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it - Waiter bring me shad roe
In shallow shoals English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The dragonflies in the reeds do it
Sentimental centipedes do it
let's do it it, let's fall in love
mos-qui-to's heaven forbid, do it
soon as every katydid do it
let's do it, lets' fall in love
The most refined lady bu-u-ugs do it
When a gentleman calls
Moths in your rugs do it
What's the use of moth balls
locusts in trees do it
bees do it
even over-educated fleas do it
let's do it, let's fall in love!
let's do it le-e-et's fall in love
let's do it, let's fall in love!
Vi båda drack för mycket vin
och vi sa fuck it, solen sken
vi stod vid Stora scen och vi sjöng
till tonerna av Lykke Li och vi
höll om varann och sa, i natt så är det du och jag
Men du försvann, gled ur min hand
vart tog du vägen, jag kan inte hitta dig
jag är för full knuffas omkull, vart tog du vägen
jag kan inte fatta att jag tappade bort dig
säg vart är du nånstans, står och skriker ditt namn
men om jag hittar dig och du bjuder med mig hem
så lovar jag att du kommer skrika mitt namn
För jag vill bara känna på din kropp kropp hela natten
men mina vänner säger stopp stopp håll i hatten
men jag vill känna på din kropp kropp hela natten
och mina vänner säger stopp
men jag vill att ditt hem blir där jag hänger min hatt
Vi båda gick hand i hand
vinglade genom en campingplats
och ramlade över ett tält
det slutade med ett skrattanfall
Du hade pluggat i Amsterdam
och samlat kraft men tappat allt
du rullade en spliff och satt i famnen på mig
allt gick snabbt
För så som jag kände
har jag aldrig känt
för någon jag kände
men aldrig har känt
Den sekunden jag tittade bort
det är den jag kommer att minnas för gott
ingen fattar
du skulle se Prince på mina axlar
Men du försvann, gled ur min hand
vart tog du vägen, jag kan inte hitta dig
jag är för full knuffas omkull, vart tog du vägen
jag kan inte fatta att, jag tappade bort dig
säg vart är du nånstans, står och skriker ditt namn
men om jag hittar dig och du bjuder med mig hem
så lovar jag att du kommer skrika mitt namn
För jag vill bara känna på din kropp kropp hela natten
men mina vänner säger stopp stopp håll i hatten
men jag vill känna på din kropp kropp hela natten
och mina vänner säger stopp
men jag vill att ditt hem blir där jag hänger min hatt
(jag vill att ditt hem blir där där jag hänger min hatt)
(jag vill att ditt hem blir där där jag hänger min hatt)
Jag kan inte fatta att jag tappade bort dig
säg vart är du nånstans, står och skriker ditt namn
men om jag hittar dig och du bjuder med mig hem
så lovar jag att du kommer skrika mitt namn
För jag vill bara känna på din kropp kropp hela natten
men mina vänner säger stopp stopp håll i hatten
men jag vill känna på din kropp kropp hela natten
och mina vänner säger stopp
men jag vill att ditt hem blir där jag hänger min hatt

This song of mine
hymn of love
I sing to you now
with my pain
so strong so great
it stabs my heart
But the morning is clear
among the fields the scent of wine
I dreamt of you and now
I see you still there
Ah, what memories
fresco of hills
I cry what madness
it was to leave and go
This melody
hymn of love
I sing to you and feel
all my pain
so strong, so great
But the morning is clear
among the fields a windmill rises
there my destiny was born
Bitter without you,
bitter without you
And this heart sings
a sweet melodrama
it's the hymn of love
I'll sing for you
It's a melodrama
I sing without you
ALL (In 3 groups)
Though it's fearful,
Though it's deep, though it's dark
And though you may lsoe the path,
Though you may encounter wolves,
You can't just act,
You can't just act
Though it's dark,
There are always wolves,
There are always spells,
There are always beans,
So it's
Into the woods
You go again,
You have to
Into the woods,
No telling when,
Into the woods,
But not too fast
Or what you wish
Into the woods, but not to stray,
Or tempt the Wolf or steal from the Giant-
The way is dark,
The light is dim,
But now there's you,
The chances look small,
The choices look grim,
But everything you learn there
BAKER, CINDERELLA, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD, JACK
The light is getting dimmer-
BAKER
I think I see a glimmer-
ALL
Into the woods-
You have to grope,
But that's the way
Into the woods
To find there's hope
Into the woods-
Each time you go,
There's more to lern
Into the woods, but not too slow-
Into the woods, it's nearing midnight-
Into the woods to mind the Wolf,
To heed the Witch,
To honor the Giant,
To mind,
To heed,
To find,
To think,
To teach,
To join,
To go to the Festival!
Into the woods,
Into the woods,
Into the woods,
Then put of the woods
And happy ever after!
CINDERELLA

You are my sunshine
The other night dear
As I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you
In my arms
When I awoke dear

From this moment you are the one
Right beside you

You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment as long as I live

There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment
I will love you as long as I live
From this moment on

  We go sailing at midnight
Oceans far and away
No past or mixed emotions
Nothing to pull in our wake
We are beyond the stars
Up where the sky is ours, yeah
We are crashing out of the cage,
As free as a couple of runaways
Surrender all we know
The future is ours untold, yeah
We are innocent and brave
As free as a couple of runaways
We speak in sign language
Unknown to sleepers and spies
With or without direction
I'll be here by your side
We are beyond the stars
Up where the sky is ours, yeah
We are crashing out of the cage,
As free as a couple of runaways
Surrender all we know
The future is ours untold, yeah
We are innocent and brave
As free as a couple of runaways
Like a couple of runaways
Oh, woah
We are beyond the stars
Up where the sky is ours, yeah
We are crashing out of the cage,
As free as a couple of runaways
Surrender all we know
The future is ours untold, yeah
We are innocent and brave
As free as a couple of runaways
Yeah a couple of runaways
Yeah a couple of runaways
Ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone
Ever had one of dem days, you wish woulda' stayed home
Run into a group of niggas, getting they hate on
You walk by, they get wrong you reply
Then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you'll get jumped
That next, they don't wanna stop
There now they bussin', now you gushin', ambulance
Rushin' you to the hospital, with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit four times, plus it hit ya
Spine paralyzed waist down, now ya wheel chair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive,
Just think it all started you, fussin' with three guys
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way you
Could fuck around, get shot die any day
Niggas die, every day all over
Bull shit dope money dice, game ordinary hood shit
Could this be, 'cause of hip hop music
Or did the ones, with the good sense
Not use it, usually niggas
Don't know what to do, when their back against the wall
So they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blo' I guess,
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight,
Now I get it now I take time to think,
Before I make mistakes, just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday, the heart of me is strong today
I ain't never been scared, I live through tragedy
Situation coulda been dead, lookin' back at it
Most of that shit, didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it, when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit didn't, next thing ya know we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about damn, what a life I had
Most of that shit, look back just laugh
Some shit, still look back just sad
Maybe my homeboy, till be around
Had I not, hit the nigga
In the mouth that time, I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga, walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see, Philant no more
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
Ida took that ass-whoopin', now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there, talk shit all night
Cause I hit you, you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight,
Now I get it now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes
Just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north,
Swallow that pill
That they call pride
The old me is dead and gone,
But the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north,
Swallow that pill
That they call pride
The old me is dead and gone,
But the new me will be alright
  Livin' easy, lovin' free
Season ticket, on a one - way ride
Askin' nothin', leave me be
Takin' everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I'd rather do
Goin' down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, payin' my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey Mama, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Dont stop me!
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell!
Highway to hell!
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
  Yeah-Eh-Eh
You are, my fire
The one, desire
Believe, when I say
I want it that way
But we, are two worlds
Apart, can't reach to
Your heart, when you say
That I want it that way
Tell me why, ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why, ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why, I never wanna hear you say
"I want it that way"
Am I (Am I, am I), your fire?
Your one, desire?
Yes I know, it's too late
But I want it that way
Tell me why, ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why, ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why, I never wanna hear you say
"I want it that way"
Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, Yeah
No matter the distance, I want you to know
That deep down inside of me
You are, my fire, the one, desire
You are (You are, you are, you are)
Don't wanna hear you say, ain't nothing but a heartache
(Eh-Eh) Ain't nothing but a mistake (Don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (Oh Yeah)
"I want it that way"
Tell me why, ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why, ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why, I never wanna hear you say
(I wanna hear you say) "I want it that way"
Tell me why, ain't nothing but a heartache
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why, I never wanna hear you say (I don't wanna hear you say)
"I want it that way," 'cause I want it that way
  You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me, through the dark
Let me take you past the sattelites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do
Love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do
Touch me like you do
To-To-Touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch, of your skin
Is a Holy Grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around
I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do
Lo-Lo-Love me like you do
Touch me like you do

  These are the days of Elijah
Declaring the Word of the Lord
And these are the days of Your servant, Moses
Righteousness being restored
And though these are days of great trial
Of famine and darkness and sword
Still we are the voice in the desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the Lord
Behold he comes
Riding on a cloud
Shining like the sun
At the trumpet's call
Lift your voice
It's the year of jubilee
Out of Zion's hill salvation comes
And these are the days of Ezekiel
The dry bones becoming as flesh
And these are the days of Your servant, David
Rebuilding the temple of praise
And these are the days of the harvest
The fields are as white in your world
And we are the laborers in your vineyard
declaring the word of the Lord
Behold he comes
Riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun
At the trumpet call
Lift your voice
It's the year of jubilee
Out of Zion's hill salvation comes
There's no God like Jehovah (x8--modulate)
There's no God like Jehovah (x8--modulate)
There's no God like Jehovah (x7)
If you do not do what you're told to do when you're told to do it,
(Aye, sir)
If you leave my base without proper authorization,
(Aye, sir)
I can't hear you!
(Aye, sir!)
Scream it!
(Aye, sir!)
Your ass belongs to me now!
  Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
  Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm 'bout to talk blunt staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here?
Are you here right now? Huh
We should all disappear right now
Look, your gettin' all your friends and your gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things, niggas see me rollin' and their mood change
Like a motherfucker
New floor, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some steps ?
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it
Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest dealin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand up or is you in your chair, right now?
Do you hear me? I can't let a wet nigga, get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put my leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? Not important
I bought some cocaine, you can snort it
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off like chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge and born in New Orleans
Get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly
Drake, Tunech and Barbie
You know
  Hey, I can be the answer
I'm ready to dance when the amp up
And when I hit that dip, get your camera
And that I am that young sis, the beacon
I could freak a 'fit, that pump with the peep and
I just wanna sip that punch with your peeps and
Sit in that lunch if you're treatin'
She know where I get mine from, end of season
Now she wanna lick my plum in the evening
And fit that ton-tongue d-deep in
I was in the 212
Word to who made ya
I'ma eat ya food up, boo
You're gay to get discovered in my two-one-deuce
Cock-a-licking in the water by the blue bayou
Caught the warm goo in your doo-rag too, son?
You could get shot, homie, if ya do want to
Put ya guns up, tell your crew don't front
Ayo (ayo), I heard you're riding with the same tall, tall tale
Telling them you made some (made some)
Saying you're grinding but you ain't going nowhere
Why you procrastinate girl? (-nate girl)
You got a lot, but you just waste all yourself
They'll forget your name soon (name soon)
And won't nobody be to blame but yourself, yeah
What you gon' do when I appear?
W-when-when I premiere?
See, even if you do want to bust
You're playing with your butter like your boo won't chew cock
The gun, too - where you do eat poon, hon?
I'm the new one too, huh?
See, I remember you when you were
The young new face, but you do like to slumber, don't you?
Now your boo up too, hon
I'ma ruin you cunt
What you gon' do when I appear?
W-when-when I premiere?
  Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me, oh lord now
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
  Si tu tombes beaucoup trop bas,
Si tu perds confiance tourne-toi vers moi,
Feel the wind blow softly through my hair,
I'm invincible whenever you are there,
Et comme un défi, tu te lèves pour aimer la vie,
Si un chagrin casse ta voix,
Perdue sur les chemins tend une main vers moi,
I feel the sun shine breeze upon my face,
When I hear your voice I know I'll be ok,
Et comme un défi, tu te lèves pour aimer la vie,
Et pour que tu sois,
Toujours plus, Toujours plus forte,
Et que le vend de la vie,
Soulève tes ailes et te transporte,
( Siffle )
(Merci à Laurent Geoffrey pour ce)
  I gotta change the station that I have
Cause all i hear is you
It just keeps reminding me
Of all the things we used to do
And I know that I should turn
Off the radio
But it's the only place I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months since I've spoken to you
(You aint keep in touch)
Don't know why it came to this no
(But enough is enough)
No more walking round with my head down
I don't wanna be a fool
Crying over you
If you're so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
You said you loved me
Why ain't you here?
I'm so sick of your love songs
So sad and slow
But I just can't turn off the radio
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 16th
Cause it seems like you forgot
That was our anniversary
When I heard your song
It made it hard to erase your memory
Now when I hear your song I know it's meant for me
I can't believe that your
So sick of love songs
So tired of tears
You said you love me
Why ain't you here?
I'm so sick of your love songs
So sad and slow
But I just can't turn off the radio
Ooh
(Now that I'm gone)
Now that I'm gone
(I wanna be left alone)
Ooh
And everytime I see your smile
It's looking at our child
You should know
Ooh why can't you move on?
If you're so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
You said you love me
Why ain't you here?
I'm so sick of your love songs
So sad and slow
But I just can't turn off the radio
(I just can't turn off the radio)
If your so sick of love songs (So sick of love songs)
so tired of tears (so tired of tears)
You said you love me
Why aren't you here? (Yeaaaah) (Why ain't you here???)
I'm so sick of your love songs
So sad and slow (Oo oh)
But I just can't turn off the radio
(I just can't turn off the radio)
If you're so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
You said you love me
Why ain't you here?
I'm so sick of your love songs
So sad and slow
But I just can't turn off the radio
(I just can't turn off the radio)
I just can't turn off the radio
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, Uh huh
So what I keep 'em rolled up
Saggin' my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
And look clean dont it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on and roll joints bigger
than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I'm with
you bitch smokin' grade A
Yeah, uh you know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I'm on the chase
Chevy, its gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keep slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front four blunts, like "Khalifa put the weed in a J"
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in here
It's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you know it
When I step right up get my lighters so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you're thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thing
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had the science project, me and Mac killed it
THC, MAC, DEV, HD3, hi it's me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight, then we gon' roll
And live off life
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
I never meant to get us in this deep
I never meant for this to mean a thing
Well, I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away
I got caught up by the chase
And you got high on every little game
I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away
Oh, if I could go back in time
When you only held me in my mind
Just a longing gone without a trace
Oh, I wish I'd never ever seen your face
I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away
I miss the way you wanted me
When I was staying just out of your reach
Begging for the slightest touch
Ooh, you couldn't get enough, mmm
Oh, if I could go back in time
When you only held me in my mind
Just a longing gone without a trace
Oh, I wish I'd never ever seen your face
I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away
Got away from me (x2)
For anybody has to breathe
Oh, if I could go back in time
When you only held me in my mind
Just a longing gone without a trace
Oh, I wish I never ever seen your face
I wish you were the one (x2)
Oh, I wish you were the one
I wish you were the one that got away
  Jenny, Jenny, who can I turn to?
You give me something I can hold onto
I know you think I'm like the others before
Who saw your name and number on the wall

  When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;
When troubles come and my heart burdened be;
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
  Driving all night just to say goodbye
Windows down, hair in the wind
Hang up the phone, it'll be a long night
Empty pillows, 2 AM
I cannot pretend I won't be lonely
Every minute that you're gone
But trust me, in the end it will be worth it
'Cause baby you're the one
I can't even face the daylight
'Cause I'm already missing you
Baby we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you
You got me la-la-la-loving you
La-la-la-loving you
You got me la-la-la-loving you
La-la-la-loving you
Loving you
Loving you
I'm missing your touch, I'm missing your smile
Love to feel your hands on my skin
Feeling the rush, it makes me go wild
Crazy how you know what I think
I cannot pretend I won't be lonely
Every minute that you're gone
But trust me, in the end it will be worth it
'Cause baby you're the one
I can't even face the daylight
'Cause I'm already missing you
Baby we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you
You got me la-la-la-loving you
La-la-la-loving you
You got me la-la-la-loving you
La-la-la-loving you
See the clock, close my eyes
Wishing I could stop the hands of time
Make this kiss, last forever (forever)
We gotta live our lives
But that won't stop me from loving you
I can't even face the daylight
'Cause I'm already missing you
Baby we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you
You got me la-la-la-loving you
La-la-la-loving you
You got me la-la-la-loving you
La-la-la-loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Driving all night just to say goodbye
Windows down, hair in the wind
I'm mad at myself, I'm stronger than that
But we've done this again and again
  It ain't necessarily so

The t'ings dat yo' li'ble
To read in de Bible,
Li'l David was small, but oh my !

Wadoo, zim bam boddle-oo,

Oh Jonah, he lived in de whale,
Oh Jonah, he lived in de whale,
Fo' he made his home in
He floated on water
Till Ol' Pharaoh's daughter,
Well, it ain't necessarily so
Well, it ain't necessarily so
Dey tells all you chillun
De debble's a villun,
But it ain't necessarily so !
To get into Hebben
Don' snap for a sebben !
Live clean ! Don' have no fault !
Oh, I takes dat gospel
Whenever it's pos'ble,
Methus'lah lived nine hundred years,
Methus'lah lived nine hundred years,
But who calls dat livin'
When no gal will give in
To no man what's nine hundred years ?
I'm preachin' dis sermon to show,
It ain't nece-ain't nece
Ain't nece-ain't nece
  Old pirates, yes, they rob I;
Sold I to the merchant ships,
Minutes after they took I
But my hand was made strong
We forward in this generation
Won't you help me sing
these songs of freedom
Are all I ever have:
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery;
Have no fear for atomic energy,
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets,
While we stand aside and look
Oh! Some say it's just a part of it:
Won't you help me sing
these songs of freedom
Are all I ever have:
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
(Guitar break)
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery;
Wo! Have no fear for atomic energy,
'Cause none of them-a can-a stop-a-the time
How long shall they kill our prophets,
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it:
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom? -
Are all I ever had:
Redemption songs -
All I ever had:
Redemption songs:
These songs of freedom,
  ye samaa, samaa hain ye pyaar kaa
kisee ke intajaar kaa
dil naa churaa le kahee meraa, mausam bahaar kaa
basane lage aakhon mein kuchh ayese sapane
koee bulaaye jaise, nainon se apane
ye samaa, samaa hain didaar kaa, kisee ke intajaar kaa
mil ke khayaalon mein hee, apane balam se
nind gawaayee apanee, maine kasam se
ye samaa, samaa hain khumaar kaa, kisee ke intajaar kaa
  here cant be separation without the crying
emories won't stay well behaved
he ones left behind carry the ones that go
in their hearts
love isn't a burden to those who love
this is how we know it - this is how we live it
ooooooooo oooooooo
she knows it as well
ooooooooo oooooooo
she's in love as well
ooooooooo oooooooo
knowing all she's defiant against love
she does as she pleases anyway
fresh as a flower valuable, the one and only
as pure as mothers milk should drink her
pleasant speaking tongue
her eyes are the likes of the sea and oceans
this heart of mine is letting her get away with things
is always hovering around her
she's so spoilt/coy
whatever it does (the heart) she overlooks it stubbornly
she makes you brood over
ooooo oooooooo
she's strongly desiring it aswell
ooooo oooooooo
(i can't make out what he says here)
ooooooooo oooooooo
knowing all she's defiant against love
she does as she pleases anyway
don't take notice of me laughing (don't believe i'm happy)
see it - hear it - but don't believe it
I'm shattered, my heart is
in ten thousand pieces
with every breath I takeat every step I take
if only my life/my darling could be here
with me now
fresh as a flower
valuable, the one and only
as pure as mothers milk
should drink her
pleasant speaking tongue
her eyes are the likes of the sea and oceans
threw all my
sorrows/worries inside (kept them inside)
t's my right to live like anyone else
(two lines here i couldn't make out also)
it's possible that it could rain everyday
people do make mistakes
perhaps if we hold on to each other
the sun may rise (be born)
  They say it's matter of time
A thousand days and the sun won't shine
Before I come back to you
I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way
For you love I will go far
I wanna be wherever you are
I'm know I'm coming back for you
Our love is a river long
The best right in a million wrongs

  A child is crying on the tv screen
Reminds us everyday of what has been
Wars a fought without an end in sight
The world's divided black and white
We know what's comming but no one acts
It's time to rise up and face the facts
If we don't try to make our move
There will soon be nothing left to prove
And we don't wanna wait
Cause the wall's gonna
Break and we say
And we all know what to do
Hold on! And reach for the sun
One by one, we change how we're living
Hold on! Cause it ain't over 'til it's over
Hold on! It's never too late
To change our faith, so don't you, let it go
Hold on! Cause it ain't over 'til it's over
We can work it out
Keep moving on
We can still be strong
Just try to get along
Another city comes tumbling down
Another ocean makes a rumbling sound
Our generation is stained with crime
The next is bound to do the time
I remember what my mama said
That our differences are all in our heads
It doesn't matter what you've done before
We all wanna see what the future has in store
No we don't wanna wait
Cause the wall's gonna
Break then we'll say
Oh, it's time we play our part
(Yeah!)
Hold on! And reach for the sun
One by one, we change how we're living (how we're living)
Hold on! Cause it ain't over 'til it's over ('til it's over)
Hold on! It's never too late (never too late)
To change our faith, so don't you, let it go
Hold on! Cause it ain't over 'til it's over
We can work it out (ahh)
Keep moving on (ahh)
We can still be strong (ahh)
Just try to get along (ahh)
Ohh
We can work it out (ahh)
Keep moving on (ahh)
We can still be strong (ahh)

(Ahh, ahh)
Keep moving on
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
(Ahh, ahh)
  I keep holdin' on
I keep, I keep, I keep holdin'
Broken footsteps on the floor,
Pick myself up and carry on, cause something's waiting for me,
And I won't let them write my song,
I'm a king without a throne, a heart without a home,
I walk the road alone, but my hope will never die
I keep holdin' on
I keep, I keep, I keep holdin'
And I'll face every hurricane, yeah
I'm a king without a throne, a heart without a home,
I walk the road alone, but my hope will never die
Yeah, yeah, I keep holding!
I keep holdin' on
I keep, I keep, I keep holdin'
I keep holdin' on

  Da-Dun-Da-Da, Da-Dun-Da-Da
Da-Dun-Da-Da-Da-Da
Da-Dun-Da-Da, Da-Dun-Da-Da
Da-Dun-Da-Da-Da-Da
Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray), I could breakaway
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes, 'till I touch the sky I'll
Make a wish, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love I'll
Take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway
Da-Dun-Da-Da, Da-Dun-Da-Da
Da-Dun-Da-Da-Da-Da
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jetplane far away
(I would pray) And breakaway
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
I'll do what it takes 'till I touch the sky I'll
Make a wish, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun (Into the sun)
But I won't forget all the ones that I love I gotta
Take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on, fly away, breakaway
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta (Tell you goodbye)
Take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun (Into the sun)
But I won't forget the place I come from I gotta
Take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway, breakaway, breakaway
  This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away I'm feeling right there
Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind
All I believe, is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own, is it just smoke and mirrors?
I wanna believe
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, but all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground, without a sound
This is my word, heart breaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
To disappear dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind
All I believe, is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own, is it just smoke and mirrors?
I wanna believe
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, but all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
Believe, all I believe
All I believe, is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own, is it just smoke and mirrors?
I wanna believe
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, but all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors)
  About one year later your daddy was born and your
grandma held my hand so tight
Oh I can't tell the joy as she brought forth new life,
He's the deflated balloon wrapped around your gait
Cut priced to clear a past to "sell by date"
He'll be fool running through the church screaming out "it's not too late"
When he does, I know that you'll wait
He's the drunk man with bad breath coming on too strong
He's the beauty queen that strings your heart along
And he'll answer every question in your new-age magazine wrong
But I know you'll love him strong
So I'm leaving before there's nothing to believe in
I'm just craving for a love I never knew
Please don't go mistreating me
I'm not saying you've been misleading me
Just not needing me the way that I need you
He's the elephant in the room that never speaks
But you dream about him every two weeks
I wouldn't know his name, but you call it in your sleep
Oh I know you love him deep
So run back to him like you should
I guess I always knew that you would
For he's captured your heart in a way I never could
So go on and love him good
So I'm leaving before there's nothing to believe in
I'm just craving for a love I've never knew
I'm the stray cat you keep feeding
You're the book I can't stop reading
But the tides are receding that it's true
So please don't go mistreating me
I'm not saying you've been misleading me,
Just not needing me the way that I need you
Just not needing me the way that I need you
  Wise men say, only fools rush in
Wise men say, only fools rush in
Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
As the river flows, Gently to the sea
Take my hand, take my whole life too
As the river flows, Gently to the sea
Darlin so we know, somethings were meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
  Girls in tight dresses
Who drag with moustaches
Chicks driving fast
Women who long love lust
This is the way
Talking, laughing, loving, breathing
Fighting, fucking, crying, drinking
Writing, winning, losing, cheating
This is the way
it's the way that we live
  Someone sucked the life out of the room
When that someone said goodbye much too soon
I'd hate for you to love me 'cause you saw me out with someone who
You read about in the news
But I guess that's what this world is coming to
I watched as your wrists began to bruise
Threading ribbons weaving patterns
Beautiful and blue
All your late nights came to life
And then died upon just one dislike
Never mind all the people that you moved
But I guess that's what this world is coming to
So let's get high here in the moonlight
Even the stars go right over our head
I think I'm gonna shine in the afterlife
Leaving the fight for peace of mind instead
So let's get high in the moonlight
Even the stars go right over our head
I know I'm gonna shine here in the afterlife
Leaving the fight for peace of mind instead
You know that I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You're the source of everything I do
You brought faith to songs I sing
So I went and bought a diamond ring
I wanna spend each night here with you
Yeah you took everything I was
And you turned it into something I've become
Good god what's a boy to do?
But I guess that's what this world
Oh, I guess that's what this world
Oh, I guess that's what this world is, is coming to
Oh, I guess that's what my life is, is coming to
Ever told on a nigga? Ever squeezed a trigger?
Ever set a nigga up?
Ever helped a nigga out when he was down on his luck?
You a sap? You a boss, player, you a mack?
Let me hold a couple dollars, y'all still be poppin' y'all collars?
Stock rims on a strape, paint wetter than a lake
Poodle in my blood? Bitch, I'm a thug
You a loser? Winner?
Starving? Dinner?
You still sell dope? Now you cleaner than a bar of Dove soap?
Got a little gouda? Got a thumper, got a Ruger?
You in love wit' the ho? She bringin' you the dough?
Everybody get choices
I choose to get money, I'm stuck to this bread
Everybody got choices
These bitches is choosin', I'm all in they head
Everybody got choices
Keep it 1 thou, I'da liked it, I chose
Everybody got choices
These niggas be hatin', I already know
But I never go broke (no, no, no)
I'mma stay gettin' money (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I ain't gotta sell my soul (no, no, no)
I'mma stay gettin' money (yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you broke, you ain't like me (no, no, no)

Ugh, lazy? Got dick that'll drive a ho crazy?
Hater? Wanna see a player get paper?
Traitor? Loyal to my soil, not a faker?
Sleep? Bust moves, hella active in the streets?
Scared of the dark? Have money, have heart?
Narc? Shark?
Gossip like a broad? Check a bitch like a smog?
Slippin'? Trippin'?
Sober as a gopher? Higher than a rollercoaster?
Star Wars? Yoda?
Never leave the house without my strap, shoot a muthafucka in his nap
Never been a sucka or a pussy, blowin' cookie,
never coughin' like a rookie
Was it love at first sight? Did she ride you like a bike?
Was it ripe? Was her pussy tight?
Got some property? Drive a Maserati?
You softer than a sock? You solid as a rock?
Slow? Trained to go?
Your team weak? You respected in the stree-neets?
Shallow? Dineat?
Broke? Chineat?
Not a BB or a pellet gun, let-alone barrel base drum
If I get into it, will run, I'mma give a nigga fair one
Still live in the trap? You ever go back?
Wear a wire and a camera? Ears to the scanner?
  (Elliphant)

Hey! Anybody wanna dance with me?
Sipping on my rum in the corner still ah!

Man a crispy, don't mean to be ruff
But I really can't stay naah, can't get enough
Puff puff puff, and I'm back to di heat
Loving it living 128 beat
Hey! Naah shake your meat
Enemy of friend is not an option
We're all the same, when we dancing go stars
Simsalabim naah, I'm a norden gyal
Bim bim salla, kicking dread lock style

Mayham rumble, till I drop and fall
Pump up, bumble bee

  When you close your eyes,
you can see the day rewind,
all the laughs and stupid fights,
Just like a party breaks at dawn,
I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return in every song that is unsaid,
our memory is always within reach,
When you're feeling empty,
I will be the fuel you need,
to keep on pushing on down the lonely street
Home like headlights on the lawn,
I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return in every song that is unsaid,
our memory is always within reach,
I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return in every song that is unsaid,
our memory is always within reach,
  "Let's get lost, lost in each other's arms
Let's get lost, let them send out alarms
And though they'll think us rather rude
Let's defrost in a romantic mist
Let's get crossed off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other, mmm, let's get lost
Let's defrost in a romantic mist
Let's get crossed off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other, mm, let's get lost
oh oh, let's get lost"

  I am unwritten
Can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning
The pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in, no one else
No one else, can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is, where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten, Yeah
Oh, Ooh
I break tradition
Sometimes my tries
Are outside the lines, Yeah-Yeah
We've been conditioned
To not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, Oh No
Staring, at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in, no one else
No one else, can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is, where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Staring, at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions, Oh-Whoa (Whoa)
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in, no one else
No one else, can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is, where your book begins
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in, no one else
No one else, can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is, where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten (Oh, Oh Whoa, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
The rest is still unwritten (Oh, Oh Whoa, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
(Oh, Oh Whoa, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)

(Outro @ 3:50)
  Australian man, Scandinavian town
Kicking stones around the square
He sat for a while, forced out a smile
As if someone would care
Said I'm a long way from the gold coast
Furthest I've ever known
This just ain't my home
It was my wife's idea but she's no longer here
She left me traveling alone
Oh I never heard silence
Ring out like a bell
I never heard silence like last night in my expensive hotel
See I'm loving a shadow, trying to catch the rain
I never heard silence, like I heard it today
Well she walked out of the hotel
I could still smell the smoke, of a burning heart left inside
She said men are all assholes and life's a bad joke
She laughed and started to cry
Well 10 years with this man and a life time of plans
You know I loved him to his bones
But now I've lines on my skin and he's traded me in
Left me traveling alone
Oh I've never heard silence
It hit me like a train
I've never felt silence
Like my blood courses through my veins
Oh I'm loving a shadow
and I'm trying to catch the rain
I never felt silence
Like I felt it today
I never felt silence
Like I felt it today
Got rocks on my wrist, that shit you can't resist
Cash flow greater than the haters hating on my gyst
Riding in your face, looking like I found a damn genie
Wilding in my Lamborghini
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini
Been in the game since Namco
Bring it back, I'm fully gassed, yo
Vroom, vroom, in my brand new Lambo
Juiced up, and I don't give a damn, yo
Going 120, and that's my slowest
On a one-way lane, like Lois
Who's that? Superman's bitch
Wanna see what happens when I touch the Superman switch?
Ride with more peers than Morgan
Drive past bloggers that are walking
I taunt them, Matt Lees, can you see me?
Wilding in my Lamborghini
I be at home on the Xbox
Lord of the Mics in the background, slewing MCs with dreadlocks
Snap that party, told this girl "come round"
Chick's long-tempered but her head top
She goes hard till my head drops
It's all eyes when we connect
Doggystyle and a Playboy bunny from downstairs, upstairs
Sound like a pet shop
Guys wanna hype on man
Poor KSI, I'll put you in a headlock
I've been around since CoD 4
Search and Destroy hardcore G3 with a red dot
Haters get treated like a ho
You can tell them suck my dick and get lost
Paparazzi wanna take pics when I'm out with my son
You can all get headshots
This flow's like Formula One
Cause I use the track like DRS
Quickly boosting the PRS
She's going ape when I beat her chest
Bro, it's mad
You can tell Rihanna come see me
Might have to speed dial in that genie
JJ, lend me the Lamborghini
When my Lambo on the track, fall back
When I'm riding at speed, get that neck crack
Blazing on the engine, everybody looking back
Like I'm shooting, gratata, got them going, "fuck that"
Raise the fucking doors, I said make it look
Like a fucking eagle, like I'm starting wars
Dictating with my V12 deagle, speeds ain't even legal
Scaring people, we ain't equal
Danny Glover ain't got shit on my motherfucking lethal weapon
Armageddon sounding when the man arrives
When we hype I come alive, like a 5 Alive
On the drive 21 years, smashing up the scene
And I keep on winning, like I'm Mr Charlie Sheen
  Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
It's always times like these
When I think of you
And wonder if you ever think of me
Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory
Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by, oh
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't
Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way through the crowd
And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, oh, oh
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonight
  I can't afford this heart
Still I am responsible
If it will fall apart
Believe me, I don't want to go
You won't believe it's true
When I tell you 'bout my feelings
And what you're supposed to do
I'm sorry, but I don't want to go
But baby, I tell ya
My heart is freaking out when I held ya
Even in the best of days
Love will be hard and hearts will be faking
Maybe you're glistening
I see it in your eyes that you're listening
But do you even understand
I have to let go of your hand
I have to let go of your hand
And then you believe in me
You took me by my hand
And told me that I made you free
I need you
I need you to know
As always I just can't cry
And I don't know the answer
But I've always wondered why
Today,
I know, today
'Cause baby, I tell ya
My heart is freaking out when I held ya
Even in the best of days
Love will be hard and hearts will be faking
Maybe, you're glistening
I see it in your eyes that you're listening
Do you even understand
I have to let go of your hand
I have to let go
I would like to believe you were right
And if I told you
Would you go there tonight
'Cause baby, I tell ya
My heart is freaking out when I held ya
Even in the best of days
Love will be hard and hearts will be faking
Maybe, you're glistening
I see it in your eyes that you're listening
But do you even understand
I have to let go of your hand
'Cause baby, I tell ya
My heart is freaking out when I held ya
Even in the best of days
Love will be hard and hearts will be faking
Maybe, you're glistening
I see it in your eyes that you're listening
But do you even understand
I have to let go of your hand
I have to let go of your hand
I have to let go of your hand, yeah
I can't afford this heart
Still I am responsible
If it will fall apart
Believe me, I don't want to go
  Todd:
There's a dawn arising on a brand new day
There's a strong wind stirring 'cross the ancient graves
There's a voice that's calling 'will you be set free?'
There's a change a coming
Let it start in me
Let it start in me
Let it start in me
There's a change a coming
Let it start in me
Adam:
There's a fire that's burning sweeping 'cross this land
There's a heat consuming every evil plan
There is gold emerging from refining flame
There's a diamond sparkling
Where there once was shame
Wes:
There's a revolution cavaliering o'er the sea
We all know it's coming people must be free
Feel the tides feel the tides a changing
Hear the waves roll in
Let this revolution wash away our sin
Let it start in me
Let it start in me
There's a change a coming
Let it start in me
David:
There's a storm a brewing
There's the sound of rain
When the thunder's rumbling 'cross the thirsty plain
Let the drought be over if we just believe that the rains are coming
Let it rain on me
Let it start, let it start in me
Amen

Lyrics written on notepad by
  I was on a heavy tip
Try'na cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side, like always
Wonderin' what to do with life
I'd already had a sip
So I'd reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side, like always
You could never make your mind
And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?
To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh, my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
You're a holy fool, all coloured blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage?
Try'na crawl in back for more
And with one kiss (And with one kiss)
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years (Twenty years)
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
But I can't beat ya, 'cause I'm still with ya
"Oh, mercy", I implore ("Oh, mercy", I implore)
How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
(Back, back, back against the wall)
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
(Back, back, back against the wall)
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
  I will tell your story if you die
I will tell your story and keep you alive the best I can
I will tell them to the children
if we have some, if we have some
But I've always felt a feeling we would die young
Some die young
Some die young
Some, some die young
But you better hold on
so many things i need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
and we said we would die together
Some die young
but you better hold on
so many things i need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
and we said we would die together
Some die young
I will tell your story if you try
but how long will your thoughts
of valleys stay green
when the world you were born in
changes with seasons
Will you run with this dream, will you run along
or will you run against and finally reveal
why some die young
Why some die young
Why some die
Some die young
but you better hold on
you better hold on
So many things i need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
and we said we would die together
Some die young
but you better hold on
So many things i need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
and we said we would die together
you said we would die
together
Some die young
but you better hold on
but you better hold on
So many things i need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
and we said we would die together
Some die young
Dum-da-de-da
Do, do, do, do, do, do
(Coming down, dripping candy on the groun')
It's that Yoncé, your Yoncé
In that lingerie, on that chardonnay
Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever like Bun B
And I'm Rambo-ing these hoes
I'm really rit like Donjae
I'm camo-ing these hoes
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy, you know I look good as fuck
Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no
We escalating, up in this bitch like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless

We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn
I wake up looking this good
And I wouldn't change it if I could
(If I could, if I, if I, could)
And you can say what you want, I'm the shit
(What you want I'm the shit, I'm the shit)
(I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit)
I want everyone to feel like this tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn!
Looking Trinidadian, Japanese and Indian
Got Malaysian, got that yaki, that wavy Brazilian
(Them bitches thirsty, I'm Hungarian)
(Nicki, BB, eat in diamond fangs, barbarian, ah)
Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me
Propofol, I know they hope I fall
But tell 'em winning is my motherfuckin' protocol
'Cause I score before I ever throw the ball

Slap these hoes on they ass like we birthing bitches, uh
The queen of rap, slayin' with Queen Bey
If you ain't on the team, you playin' for team D

All this drank in my cup like this
All this ass on that flawless dick

I'm with some flawless bitches because they mobbin' pretty
Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly
Throw that ass back, I be on my frisbee
Princess cut diamonds on my Disney
He want monster Nicki in Sri Lanka
I told him meet me at the Trump, Ivanka
I said come here, let me show you how this cookie taste
This that "Yeah, nigga, eat the cookie" face
(Right, right, right)
There's always that one person that will always have your heart
You'll never see it coming cause you're blinded from the start
Know that you're that one for me, it's clear for everyone to see
You'll always be my boo
See, I don't know about y'all but I know about us and uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know about y'all but I know about us and uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
Do you remember, girl, I was the one who gave you your first kiss
Cause I remember, girl, I was the one who said put your lips like this
Even before all the fame and people screamin your name
Girl, I was there and you were my baby
It started when we were younger you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over but it's still in you're eyes (my boo)
Even though we use to argue it's all right (my boo)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger you were mine (my boo)
When I see you from time to time I still feel like (my boo)
You can see it no matter how I try to hide (my boo)
And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo
Yes, I remember, boy, cause after we kissed
I can only think about you're lips
Yes, I remember, boy, the moment I knew
You were the one I could spend my life with
Even before all the fame and people screamin your name
I was there and you were my baby
It started when we were younger you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over but it's still in you're eyes (my boo)
Even though we use to argue it's all right (my boo)

  City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess ev'ry form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night, anticipating
She rushes to his arms,they fall together
She whispers that it's only for awhile
She swears that soon she'll be comin' back forever
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
  In this house where I grew up
With cozy chairs and broken cups
Memories piled up to the ceiling
Can they tell what I am feeling
I know this house outside and in
But three birds fly upon my skin
Lay my head down in the darkness
Like so many nights before this
In this bed where I rest, I'm homeless
This house I know best but I'm homeless
My hunger it grows and it won't let me go
And it burns in my chest, I'm homeless
Heavy steps on hardwood floors
Into my room trough broken doors
Try to leave this day behind me
But peace will never find me
In this bed where I rest, I'm homeless
This house I know best but I'm homeless
My hunger it grows and it won't let me go
And it burns in my chest, I'm homeless
I have a place I can call my own
That's where I go til the night is gone
I travel my mind and into my heart
Nobody knows when I go that far
In this bed where I rest, I'm homeless
This house I know best but I'm homeless
My hunger it grows and it won't let me go
You know your heart is mine
And you love me forever
You know your heart is mine
And you love me forever
Baby your heart is mine
And you love me forever
Baby your heart is mine
And you love me forever
No te asombres
Si una noche
Entro a tu cuarto y nuevamente te hago mía
Bien conoces
Mis errores
El egoísmo de ser dueño de tu vida
Eres mía (mía mía mía)
No te hagas la loca eso muy bien ya lo sabias
Si tu te casas
El día de tu boda
Le digo a tu esposo con risas
Que solo es prestada
La mujer que ama
Porque sigues siendo mía
  Feelin' a nikka
Make a de no no
Make a de shake em, shake em
Shake em, shake em
Shake em, shake em
Baby, I know you feelin' me
But you know that you're killin' me
And if I do know any better, I would a thought you're my enemy
By the way that you teasing me and you know you wanna give it to me
But you keep holdin' back on the cookie, saying that I got too many
But you know it's a lie, I'm the type of guy
That will make you feel so nice that you can't deny
Just so attached to me and you don't know why
And you gonna end up in a limo showing me how to ride
Feelin' a nikka
Make a de no no
Make a de shake em, shake em
Shake em, shake em
Shake em, shake em
  They say I'm young
But my purpose is the inspiration of a nation innovation
Til I change the talk into a conversation
I'm like a doctor and my patients are anxiously waiting
Healing all the hating
That faking in the paper chasin'
It's hard to live up to these expectations that I'm facing
And gain the admiration of an older generation
That's why I'm pacing back and forth contemplating
Meditating how to use what I've been taught as a positive force
Oh! (Oh!)
This is who I am
(Its all me y'all)
I wish you'd understand
(I'm bein' freed y'all)
It's time to set me free
My guardian angel
No! (No!)
No matter what I do
(They try and stop me)
I'm still a part of you
(But they can't stop me)
I hope you'll always be
My guardian angel
I wanna be the greatest in the world
Not for the money or the fame or the girls
Not for the car keys, or the jetskis or the vacation to the West Indies
But simply 'cause I love it
When I write I'm like a puppeteer
Pullin' my strings till the melody sings
And the honesty makes me spread my wings
Just calling me out was out of your mind
Send that thought back down your spine
I'm on the grind, it's all on the line
Both sides say both ways at the same time
Most days I can't wait to rhyme
Express my stress, elevate and shine
Progress, regress, each step's a climb
So I take that test and I testify
Oh! (Oh!)
This is who I am
(Its all me y'all )
I wish you'd understand
(I'm bein' freed y'all )
It's time to set me free
My guardian angel
No! (No!)
No matter what I do
(They try and stop me)
I'm still a part of you
(But they can't stop me)
I hope you'll always be
My guardian angel
I feel so misunderstood
'Cause my intentions were good
If you could only see that poetry can hide in the hood
The passion in philosophy of possibilities
Every dream is in my reach
I'll find my freedom in this beat
Follow me now, it's a whole new ground
Swallow your pride I'll make you proud
All of my life I've lived out loud
We just preached to different crowds
Oh!
This is who I am
I wish you'd understand
It's time to set me free
My guardian angel
Oh! (Oh!)
This is who I am
(Its all me y'all)
I wish you'd understand
(I'm bein' freed y'all)
It's time to set me free
My guardian angel
No! (No!)
No matter what I do
(They try and stop me)
I'm still a part of you
(But they can't stop me)
I hope you'll always be
My guardian angel
  There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still we're often told "seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain girl/lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet
She's the big affair I cannot forget
Only girl/man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add her/him initials to my monogram
Tell me where's the shepherd for this lost lamb
There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she/he turns out to be
Someone to watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me
Although I/he may not be the man some girls think of
As handsome to my heart
She/he carries the key
Won't you tell her/him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me
  This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud
It's my life
It's now or never
But I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive (It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
This is for ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
You've got to make your owns breaks
It's my life
And It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live when I'm alive (It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend don't break, baby don't back down
It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live when I'm alive (It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live when I'm alive (It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life!
  There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit, that it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this, and I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe, but it's all coming back to me
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow, Baby-Baby
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
That whenever you'd try to hurt me
I'd just hurt you even worse than so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever (Forever)
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago, but it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this, and if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind, but it's all coming back to me
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow, Baby-Baby-Baby
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
When I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But its all coming back to me now
(It's all coming back to me now) And when you kiss me like this
(It's all coming back to me now) And when I touch you like that
(It's all coming back to me now) And If you do it like this
(It's all coming back to me now) And if we

But I'm the only nigga ever to check Nike
Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin'
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my wedding
They say I'm crazy but that's the best thing going for me
You can't Lynch Marshawn, and Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of em
I believe you like a fat trainer takin' a bite or somethin'

"Yeah my nigga", Its on, its on, its on, its on

I am the light and the beacon, you can ask the deacon
It's funny when you get extra money
Every joke you tell just be extra funny
I mean you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me
Oxford want a full blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, skrrtt like hop, I'd hopped out, wassup
Erg erg erg, step back, hold up, my leg'll be stuck
I studied the proportions, emotions runnin' out of Autobahn
Speed level, had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God
He said "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"
For your boy
I'm tryna pop the McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freaks and Geeks got a trampoline in my room

And consumes the rest of me

You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You little dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't I don't give a fuck
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that its makin' me sick
I see you calling, I be makin' it quick
Imma answer that shit like: "I don't fuck with you"
Bitch I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah
And everyday I wake up celebratin' shit, why?
Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories, that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me, she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'm gonna text your ass back like
Got a million things on my mind
Executive deals online, limited amount of time
Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You might be able to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I coulda put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choose him, that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go home, listen
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Ass never rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank a lot for
Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah we in the buildin' but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til your unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah I know that karma's too real so I hope you doin' cool
But still stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass I ain't fuckin with
I ain't fuckin', I ain't I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you
  A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I've saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face
I'm here without you, Baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, Baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, Baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight
It's only you and me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e Yeah
The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say "Hello"
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go
Ho-Oh-Yeah, Yeah
I'm here without you, Baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, Baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, Baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, Girl
It's only you and me
Everything I know (Yeah)
And anywhere I go Whoa (Yeah)
It gets hard but it won't take away (Yeah-Yeah)
My love (Yeah-Yeah-Yeah)
And when the last one falls (Whoa)
When it's all said and done
It gets hard but it won't take, away, my love
Whoa-Oh-Whoa-Oh-Whoa, Whoa-Whoa, Whoa-Whoa
I'm here without you, Baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, Baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, Baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, Girl

And I'll be there just helping you out
Whenever I can

Whether you're Louie Vuittonin' it up, or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they serving on a plater
So what we gon have dessert or disaster?
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking about our life, our house and kids (Yeah)
Every morning I look at you and smile
Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down (knocked me down)
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around)
and it knocks you down

when it knocks you down (knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
and it knocks you down
just get back up
when it knocks you down (knocks you down)
I never thought I hear myself say
Y'all go ahead
I think I'm going to kick it with my girl today
I used to be commander-in-chief for my pimp ship flying high
Till i met this pretty little missile, who shot me out the sky
So now I'm crashing don't know how it happened
but i know it feels so damn good
Said if i could go back and make it happen faster

Miss independent, to the fullest, the load never too much

I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight

and it knocks you down

when it knocks you down (knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around

Tell me now can you it make past your caspers
So we could finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
to seem to only date the head of football teams,
and i was the class clown that always kept you laughing
we were never meant to be, baby we just happened
so please don't mess up the trick,
hey young world, i'm the new slick rick,
they say i move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us,
let the hour glass pass right into ashes
let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
so i wrote this love letter right before my classes
how could a goddess ask someone that's only average, for advice
o-m-g you listen to that bitch?
woah is me, baby this is tragic
cause we had it, we was magic
i was flying, now i'm crashing
this is bad, real bad, michael jackson
now i'm mad, real mad, joe jackson
you should leave your boyfriend now, i'ma ask him
so you gotta take the good with the bad, the happy and the sad
or will you bring the better future then i had in the past
cause i don't want to make the same mistakes i did
i don't wanna fall back on my face again
woah, woah
i'll admit it, i was scared to answer loves call
woah, woah
and if it hits, better make it worth the fall
(When it comes around)
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around)
and it knocks you down
just get back up
when it knocks you down (knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around (comes around)
and it knocks you down

when it knocks you down (knocks you down)
Won't see it coming when it happens
but when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
you see when love comes knocks you down
Won't see it coming when it happens
but when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
you see when love knocks you down
  Wasn't looking for it to heal the scar
But today I was riding on lonely boulevard
Wishing all wasn't lost and then there, there you came
Honestly a star shooting through the scene
In the sky, that's where we are, and I'm tryna catch a beam
See them other girls, yeah they try, but they ain't fly like you
Tonight belongs to you
Tonight belongs to you
And I'm so glad I found you
I'm so glad I found you
You're all by yourself and I came to help
I was down, it wasn't right, you came from outta left
You made a storm up in Ibiza, oh, oh what a dream
I close my eyes baby, now I don't wanna go
I'mma star, cause if I'm dreaming I don't wanna wake up
Flo Rida, ayo Jeremih, lemme holla at lil mama right quick
I know who you are, you're a rider, girl on fire, ghetto superstar
And I can't deny it, girl your body's so damn beautiful
Let me see you turn around like ay,
baby go on drop it to the ground like ay
Red lips, yellow bone green like ay,
eyes popping baby 'til I beat the thing right
Oh now, feeling like y'all finally found out, what what what what,
slow down
Pull the trigger too fast and I'll bust my gun gun gun gun,
o conversation
Don't stop with all the shaking, them other girls really basic
You amazing, so glad I got you girl
My eyes were closed but my mind was awake
Pretended I was breathing in a deep sleep pace
Got dressed so quietly
I was frozen by the jingle of my keys at the door
As I got outside I smiled to the dog
I didn't wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So I took my things and got out of your way now girl
Why didn't you wake me up
I'm pretty sure I would have told you to stop
Lets try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday
Why would you think like that
Yeah, we fight a lot but in the end
You and I we're a perfect match
I wouldn't want it any other way
But now your gone and I'm all alone
Lying here naked and staring at the phone
2xREF
(Murder inc)
What's my mother fucking name?
(R-U-L-E)
Blowin' back on this Mary Jane I'm analyzing the game
(And the game done unchose me)
Bring pain to pussy niggas and pussy holes they one in the same
(Ever since you told me)
Theres only room for tow, I been making less room for you
(Now only God can hold me)
Hug me, love me, judge me, the only man that hoves above me
Holla!
I met so many men
It's like they're all the same
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feeling sexy
Who's gonna come for me?
My only problem is
Their insecurity
Are you tired of bein' alone? (Yeah yeah)
('Cause I'm real)
The way you walk
The way you move
The way you talk
('Cause I'm real)
The way you stare
The way you look
Your style your hair
('Cause I'm real)
The way you smile
The way you smell
It drives me wild
('Cause I'm real)
And I can't go on without you
I've been thinking 'bout the re-lation-ship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets?
'Cause we been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time even if it was part-time
Now they been looking at me smiling at me
Laughing like we wasnt happy
But not knowing that we growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin' straight thuggin'
Bitch I ain't doing this shit for nothin'
I'm here to get it poppin' and hoppin'
Let's ride out in the benz, hair blowing in the wind
Sun glistening off my skin
Hhy! I'm nasty, you know me, but your still gonna fuck witcha baby
('Cause I'm real)
The way you walk
The way you move
The way you talk
('Cause I'm real)
The way you stare
The way you look
Your style your hair
('Cause I'm real)
The way you smile
The way you smell
It drives me wild
('Cause I'm real)
And I can't go on without you
Now people lovin' me and hatin' me, treatin me ungreatfully
But not knowin' that they aint makin' or breakin' me
My life, I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again baby now I can breathe again
Now people screaming "what the deal with you and so-and-so?"
I tell 'em niggas mind their biz but they dont hear me though
'Cause I live life to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby now I can breathe again
Are you tired of bein' alone? (Yeah yeah)
('Cause I'm real)
The way you walk
The way you move
The way you talk
('Cause I'm real)
The way you stare
The way you look
Your style your hair
('Cause I'm real)
The way you smile
The way you smell
It drives me wild

Part two, it's so crazy right now
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame

Your ass belongs to me now
When I first saw you,
I said "Oh my,
Ooh, I needed a dream
When it all seemed
To go bad;
And I have had the most
Beautifull dreams
When I first saw you,
I said "Oh my,
I needed a dream
You were the only
You were my dream,
All the things
You were my dream,
Who could believe
They would ever come true?
And who would believe?
The world would believe
Before you were here,
And day in,
And day out,
Ooh
  I'm standing on the bridge
I'm waiting in the dark
I thought that you'd be here, by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening but there's, no sound
Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life, won't you
Take me by the hand take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you, MMM-MMM
I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is anybody here, I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone
Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life, won't you
Take me by the hand take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you, Yeah-Yeah, Oh!
Why is everything so confusing?
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah-Yeah-Yeah, Yeah-Yeah
Yeah-Yeah, Yeah-Yeah, Yeah! Oh-Ho!
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life, won't you
Take me by the hand take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you! I'm with you!
Take me by the hand take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you! I'm with you!
Take me by the hand take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you I'm
I'm with you, I'm with you
  These are the days when I can't forgive myself
Seeing those picture of you with someone else
I wish you were here to turn darkness into light
If you were here, tonight
I'd find a million ways to say I love you
Sing a million songs to make you smile
But I can't turn back time
And I can't make you mine
It's impossible
Don't ever think that I'm proud of what I've done
What we had in common, now it's gone
I'd find a million ways to say I love you
Sing a million songs to make you smile
But I can't turn back time
And I can't make you mine
It's impossible
It's impossible to bring you back
And even if I try to turn your heart
it's impossible to turn back time
It's impossible
(To even think that you would look my way)
To even think that you would look my way
(I know I only have myself to blame)
I know I only have myself to blame
I can try, but I still can't make you mine
I'd find a million ways to say I love you
Sing a million songs to make you smile
But I can't turn back time
And I can't make you mine
It's impossible
It's impossible to bring you back
And even if i try to turn your heart
It's impossible to turn back time
It's impossible
(To even think that you would look my way)
To even think that you would look my way
(I know I only have myself to blame)
I know I only have myself to blame
I can try, but I still can't make you mine
(To even think that you would look my way)
Can't make you mine
(I know I only have myself to blame)
Can't make you mine
I could try but I still can't make you mine
  I go to loud places to search for someone
To be quiet with who will take me home
You go to loud places to find someone who
Will take you higher then I took you
Didn't I take you to higher places you can't reach without me?
Reach without me?
I'm gone into old paces where we used to go
They seem so quiet now
I'm here, all alone
You gone to new places with I don't know who
And I don't know how to follow you
I take you, I take you higher
I take you, I take you higher
I take you, I take you higher
Didn't I take you to higher places you can't reach without me?
Reach without me!
You're an ecstasy without me
When you come down
I won't be around!
  A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes
I screamed aloud, as it tore through them, and now it's left me blind
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
And in the dark, I can hear your heartbeat
I tried to find the sound
But then, it stopped, and I was in the darkness,
So darkness I became
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
I took the stars from my eyes, and then I made a map
And knew that somehow I could find my way back
Then I heard your heart beating, you were in the darkness too
So I stayed in the darkness with you
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
  When you gonna stop breaking my heart
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go, don't let go to my love
I can fix all those lies, oh, baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
Can I get to your soul ? Can you get to my thoughts ?
Can you promise we won't let go ?
All the things that I need, all the things that you need
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I touch your body, I feel I'm losing control
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I see you baby, I just don't wanna let go
When you gonna stop breaking my heart
I can fix all those lies, oh, baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
Oh, baby, I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air, when I'm not with you
Please, don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
  I don't know why I don't see happiness in this town
Everyone I meet seems so uptight wearing they frown
What good's living where dreams come true if nobody smiles?
Everyone's chasing the latest star, the latest style
You take me to another space and time
I'm bout to get out of the race, I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you
I don't know if I'm the fool who's getting this all wrong
That's the dream, to sing the perfect girl the perfect song
All I know is I can't keep on wearing this disguise
When you're the only one that seems worth stealing my eyes
You take me to another space and time
I'm bout to get out of the race, I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you
You take me to another place, place
You take me to another place, place
You take me to a higher place
You take me to another space and time
I'm bout to get out of the race, I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you
Space, space, space, space
Space, space, space, space
So I'm about to get out of the race, I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you

  Bengawan Solo
Riwayatmu ini
Perhatian insani
Musim kemarau
Tak seberapa airmu
Meluap sampai jauh
Mata airmu dari Solo
Terkurung gunung seribu
Air meluap sampai jauh
Dan akhirnya ke laut
Itu perahu
Riwayatnya dulu
Naik itu perahu
  You stood before creation
Eternity within Your hand
You spoke the earth into motion
My soul now to stand
You stood before my failure
Carried the Cross for my shame
My sin weighed upon Your shoulders
My soul now to stand
So what can I say
What can I do
But offer this heart O God
Completely to You
So I'll walk upon salvation
Your Spirit alive in me
This life to declare Your promise
My soul now to stand
So what can I say
What can I do
But offer this heart O God
Completely to You
So I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the One who gave it all
So I'll stand
My soul Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours
  There's a gold shadow seeping through the door
There's a cold sparrow lying still upon the floor
Dead and true as lipstick
Slow as the speed of skin
There's a gold, gold shadow growing from within
There's a bent willow in the moonlight painted blue
There's a spent window silhouetting you
Deep and true as whiskey
Soft and sure as lies
There's a bent, bent willow reflecting in your eyes
But now there's a girl out in a boat
Her arms are outstretched and she's barely afloat
There's a man on the shore, a rope in his hands
It's tied to the boat, and he's pulling as hard as he can
Not to bring her to him,but to pull the whole shore
and the whole world with it to her open door
All his voices are her
All his voices are her
Has he been here before?
Nobody's sure
There's a silver distance, a luminescent glimpse
There's a river of resistance, dried to cracks upon your lips
Brittle as believing
Sticky as betrayal
There's a silver distance opening up like a trail
There was a time before all the leaves
covered the beauty of Adam & Eve
And they were blind, and they were free
To be whatever they wanted to be
But now they are just a prayer in a song
And he is so sorry for all that went wrong
All his voices are her
All his voices are her
Has he been here before?
Has he been here before?
  My Saturday job pays six and six down
A copy boy at the Chronicle
Five cigarettes and two silver half crowns
Meeting Vince at Mark Toney's in town
Boy, do we get around
Basil sits there on the table for subs
But not a part of the Bri-nylon club
Ancient blue sweater, too old for the job
Bored out of his mind
With the Colins and Bobs
I'm a jack and a lad
And I'm up for the world
And I've kissed a Gateshead girl
He calls for a copy boy, grumpy as hell
Poets have to eat as well
What he wouldn't give just to walk out today
To have time to think about time
And young love thrown away
I'm a jack and a lad
And I'm up for the world
And I've kissed a Gateshead girl
Starlings swarming
A cloud over Grainger Street
Over the black church
Over the Black Gate
And the shadowy Keep
He peers through his wire rims
At the fish and chip words
He's supposed to dish up and forget
His drudgery now has become slightly blurred
By one of his Players untipped cigarettes
Bury all joy
Put the poems in sacks
And bury me here with the hacks
In the summer the fair
Will stretch over the Moor
Lovers will lie and make out in the park
Basil puts on his old duffel and scarf
And goes out into the dark
  Ooh-Ooh
I hope the days come easy and the moments pass slow
And each road leads you where you wanna go
And if you're faced with the choice and you have to choose
I hope you choose the one, that means the most to you
And if one door opens to another door closed
I hope you keep on walking 'till you find the window
If it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile
But more than anything, more than anything
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes
All that you want it to your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too, Yeah this, is my wish
I hope you never look back but you never forget
All the ones who love you and the place you left
I hope you always forgive, and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you find God's grace, in every mistake
And always give more than you take
But more than anything (More than anything)
Yeah more than anything
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes
All that you want it to your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too, Yeah this, is my wish
Yeah-Eh-Eh-Yeah
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes
All that you want it to your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too, Yeah this, is my wish (My wish, for you)
This is my wish (My wish, for you)
I hope you know somebody loves you (My wish, for you)
May all your dreams stay big (My wish, for you)
  Down in the valley the valley so low
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow
Hear the wind blow love, hear the wind blow
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow
Roses love sunshine, violets love dew
Angels in heaven, know i love you
If you don't love me, love whom you please
Put your arms round me, give my heart ease
Give my heart ease love, give my heart ease
Put your arms round me, give my heart ease
Write me a letter, send it by mail
Send it in care of, the Birmingham Jail
Birmingham Jail love, Birmingham Jail
Send it in care of, the Birmingham Jail
Build me a castle, forty feet high
So I can see her, as she rides by
As she rides by love, as she rides by
So I can see her, as she rides by
Down in the valley, the valley so low
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow
  Take me back into the arms I love
Need me like you did before
Touch me once again
And remember when there was no one but you I wanted more
She won't love you, like I will
I'm the one who'll stay
When she walks away
I'm the one who wants to love you more
You will see I can give you everything you need
Let me be the one to love you more
See me as if you never knew
Hold me so you can't let go
Just believe in me
I will make you see
All the things that your heart needs to know
I'll be waiting for you
Here inside my heart
I'm the one who wants to love you more
You will see I can give you everything you need
Let me be the one to love you most
Somewhere all the love that we have
can be saved
What ever it takes
We'll find a way
Believe me (believe me)
I will make you see
All the things that your heart needs to know
I'll be waiting for you
Here inside my heart
I'm the one who wants to love you more
You will see I can give you everything you need
Let me be the one to love you more

Got a feeling that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
You ain't heard my album? who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fucking read-along
Ain't a fucking sing-along unless you brought the weed along
Then Juuuuuuuuu (laughs) Then Juuuust drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put The Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' bout is not up for discussion
I won't pay to make it bigger I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know then I don't trust it
If you comin' from out here then muhhfucka get to bustin'
Yes Looooooooooooorrd I don't really say this often
But this long dick nigga ain't for the long talkin
I beast
Yeah ho this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she's from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vacate in Atlanta, then she going back to Cali
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
Aka Benz is to me is just a car
That mean your friends need to be up to par
See my standards are papered by threesomes tomorrow
Kill em all dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved listen to what the crystal ball say
Halle berry, hallelujah
Holla back i'll do ya
Beast
  See the curtains hangin' in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light-a-shinin' through the window
Lets me know everything's all right
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind
See the paper layin' on the sidewalk
A little music from the house next door
So I walk on up to the doorstep
Through the screen and across the floor
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Sweet days of summer -- the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
And I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there, not a care in the world
See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
Food's cookin' and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
  Woooh
Cisilia er i din højtaler
Ha ha ha
Yeah!
Na na na na na na na nah
  Looking out standing over the edge
Too numb to feel alive
So why the fuck are these thoughts in my head
Reach in and pull them out
Still nothing feels the same
Too late to hesitate
Why can't I run and escape from myself
And live again
Why can't I run and escape from myself
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
'Cause I know that in the end
There's no way out
Oh my god is this really the end
I guess I'm not alright
I just can't tell what is real anymore
I'm trapped in my own hell
I know this can't be real
This negativity
Is dominating and smothering me
I just can't breathe
And I just can't tell what is real any more
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
'Cause I know that in the end
There's no way out
There's nothing left for me
Just tainted memories
There's no one here for me
Just let me be
Why can't I run and escape from myself
I just can't tell what is real any more
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
'Cause I know that in the end
There's no way out
Oh my god is this really the end
  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go shawty- ish yo birthday

  We stayed afloat for just a while
We dared to swim alone
Dark water left your sinking heart to drown
I know it's much too late to try
You're never coming home
When the tide came in you left without a sound
We don't say, what we should say
We get lost beyond the answer we find loneliness
We pretend but in the end
We get lost beyond the answer we find loneliness
I never thought to hold you
I never thought that you might need an anchor
I never thought I'd lose you
I never thought that you might need an anchor
I've seen your face so many times
You've stood in front of me
It was all so real
It was all so hard to see
I'm chasing ghosts and alibis
Who speak so quietly
I can almost hear you say
Don't cry for me
We don't say, what we should say
We get lost beyond the answer, we find loneliness
We pretend but in the end
We get lost beyond the answer, we find loneliness
I never thought to hold you
I never thought that you might need an anchor
I never thought I'd lose you
I never thought that you might need an anchor
Now this is all on me
Take my apology
I never though it would end
Like it did here
Now this is all on me
Take apology
It's all on me
This is all on me
I never thought to hold you
I never thought that you might need an anchor
(need an anchor)
I never thought I'd lose you
I never thought that you might need an anchor
(need an anchor)
(never thought you'd need an anchor) 4x
  Du tror att jag inte förstår dig,
Du har sett så många platser
Jag visst det har du nog
Du vet hur allt ska va'
Och trots det så tänker jag
Finns mycket mera kunskap än du tror
Än du tror
Du tror du äger jorden som du står på
Att allt blir ditt där du har gått i hamn
Men berg och träd, ja allt som finns omkring dig
Har ett liv, har en ande, har ett namn
Du tror att dom som du vill kalla människor
Ska se ut och alltid tänka just som du
Men om du följer spår du aldrig sett för
Kan du lära med ditt hjärta här och nu
Har du hört en varg som ylar under månens ljus
En vildkatt blir en stjärnbild mot din kind
Kan du sjunga högt med bergens alla röster
Kan du måla allt med färger i en vind
Kan du måla allt med färger i en vind
Kom spring på gömda stigarna i skogen
Kom smaka söta bär av sol och jord
Kom njut av överflödet i naturen
Allt du ser har ett värde utan ord
En gränslös värld för oss och alla andra
Och varje litet liv ska va en vän
För alltid ska vi tillhöra varandra
I en kretsgång utan slut här ser vi den
Hur högt orkar trädet att nå?
Om du fäller det, vem kan svara då?
Och du hör nog aldrig vargen
Under månens ljus
För vilken färg vi än har på vår kind
Måste sjunga högt med bergens alla röster
Måste måla allt med färger i en vind
Du kan äga jorden här
Den får liv först när du lär dig att se
Att det finns färger
I en vind
  Who are they? Who are you? Who am I?
Who are they? Who are you?
Manaman came from the jungle
Wild animal I've never been humble
Summertime that's the rule when I come dudes
When the beat drops it be lookin' like a rumble
Bricky boy I used to run from the feds
And girls wanna ride ball like a ped
Right now girl we don't need a bed
That I ain't tryna make love that be messin' up my head
075 yeah she gave me her line
Keep it on the low ??? say my name ???
If they ask who I am babe please tell a lie
I just be that sideman that boom bye bye
In the morning, daytime, even in the night
Anything I say she be like that's right
Anything I do she be like that's nice
If I really want to
Who are they? Who are you?
We can time travel to my yard
Excited ??? car
I'm a fixer, fix that heart
You can never be sick when you're chillin' with moi
Chillin' with me, me and the crew
Pretty ??? wifey she likes how I move
Who are they? Who are you? Who am I?
Who am I?
Who are they? Who are you?
Who am I?
Who!
  Don't worry about that extra line
That's creeping up upon your face
It's just a part of nature's way
To say you've grown a little more
Trees have rings and thicker branches
Kids shoes get a little tighter
Every year we're getting closer to who we're gonna be
It's time to celebrate the story of how you've come to be
Happy birthday my friend
Here's to all the years we've shared together
All the fun we've had
You're such a blessing
Such a joy in my life
May the good Lord bless you
And may all your dreams come true
So light a candle on your cake
For every smile you've helped create
For every heart and every soul
You've known to grow a little more
A few more pounds, a little more grey
Don't count the years just count the way
It takes a little time to go from water into wine
Don't ever lose the wonder of the child within your eyes
Happy birthday my friend
Here's to all the years we've shared together
All the fun we've had
It's such a blessing
Such a joy in my life
May the good Lord bless you
And may all your dreams come true
  We drive so far, to get away
Never look back, we don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Gotta break free, like a shooting star
Let the skyline guide us
We don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Feels like heaven, nothing can stop us now
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can hold us down
Just like a wave that never breaks
Nothing can stop us now
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
All lights go out and fade away
Never lose faith, leave all of your fears behind
A sweet escape
Gotta break free, with an open heart
Let the sunshine find us
We don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Feels like heaven, nothing can stop us now
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can hold us down
Just like a wave that never breaks
Nothing can stop us now
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can stop us now
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey
  O taste and see
That the Lord is good
O taste and see
That the Lord is good
He is good to me
You've turned my mourning
Into dancing
Put off my rags and clothed me with gladness
And I will arise and I will praise you
I'll sing and not be silent
O Lord, My God
I will give thanks to you forever
O Lord, My God
I will give thanks to you
And I'll live only for you
And I'll lift these hands up to you
And I'll dance before you
I will shout it, I will shout it to you
  Yeah!

Al Salam Aleiko Si L Sayed

Everything is so tight gotta get you so right

edicate in the elevator about the liberty!
The king is the king whether east to west
But a real king step with his impress

  Far beyond their nations' borders
There's an army on the march
For religion king and glory
In the name of Christ their enemies chastise
Taking orders from the heavens
Through hostile fire they will march
Unaffected by the volleys
Facing death their faith will keep their fear at bay
Into battle facing the fire Lord thy will be done
Into battle walk in a line
See the white in their eyes Caroleans are marching on
Put their lives in God's hand for their kingdom and fatherland
See the white in their eyes Caroleans are marching on
Morale and discipline unites them
A common faith to keep them strong
Always on their way to heaven
In the name of Christ their enemies chastise
Into battle facing the fire Lord thy will be done
Into battle walk in a line
See the white in their eyes Caroleans are marching on
Put their lives in God's hand for their kingdom and fatherland
See the white in their eyes Caroleans are marching on
Fader vår som som är i himmelen helgat varde ditt namn
Tillkomme ditt rike ske din vilja
Såsom i himmelen så ock uppå jorden ge oss bröd ock idag
Och förlåt oss våran skuld
Ahead facing the lead
And army of Swedes performing God's deeds
Showing no fear their judgement is near
Making their sacrifice
When then king and his men
Their enemies sight prepare for the fight
Banners held high ready to die
Hear how they praise the Lord
Into battle facing the fire Lord thy will be done
Into battle walk in a line
See the white in their eyes Caroleans are marching on
Put their lives in God's hand for their kingdom and fatherland
See the white in their eyes Caroleans are marching on
Fader vår som som är i himmelen helgat varde ditt namn
Tillkomme ditt rike ske din vilja
Såsom i himmelen så ock uppå jorden ge oss bröd ock idag

Turn into a bond and that bond will never
Be broken and the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first then the line
Will never be crossed established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what
We reach so remember me when I'm goneHow could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last rideSo let the light guide your way hold every memory

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?When your looks don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeksAnd darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I amSo honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we areWhen my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memoryI'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understandBut baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh(Ah la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la)So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we areOh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we areWhen tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comesAnd though the road is long
I look up to the sky
And in the dark I found,
I lost hope that I won't fly
And I sing along, I sing along
And I sing alongI got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're getting me, getting me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're getting me, getting me through the night
'Cause you're my flashlight (flashlight)

What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright[Bridge]
My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh[Verse]
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you[Bridge]
My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh
Give me all of you, oh oh[Bridge]
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all though it's hard[Chorus]
Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of youI give you all of me
And you give me all, of you, oh oh oh.Aladdin: I can show you the world

Not a footprint to be seen.
A kingdom of isolation,
and it looks like I'm the Queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in;
Heaven knows I've triedDon't let them in,
don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel,
don't let them know
Well now they knowLet it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymoreLet it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care
what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on.
The cold never bothered me anywayIt's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at allIt's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me,
I'm free!Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage onMy power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the pastLet it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand
In the light of day
Let the storm rage onThe cold never bothered me anyway!And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weaponsAnd I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah let's be clear, I'll trust no one[Pre-Chorus]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace[Chorus]
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cos I've got an elastic heartAnd I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my lifeAnd I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one[Pre-Chorus]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace[Chorus]
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cos I've got an elastic heartI got my ticket for the long way round
Two bottles of whiskey for the way
And I sure would like some sweet company
And I'm leaving tomorrow, what do you sayWhen I'm gone
When I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me by my hair
You're gonna miss me everywhere, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm goneWhen I'm gone
When I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me by my walk
You're gonna miss me talk, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm goneI got my ticket for the long way round
The one with the prettiest of views
It's got mountains
It's got rivers
It's got sights to give you shivers
But it sure would be prettier with youWhen I'm gone
When I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me by my walk
You're gonna miss me by my talk, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm goneWhen I'm gone
When I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me by my hair
You're gonna miss me by my everywhere, oh
Oh you're sure gonna miss me when I'm goneWhen I'm gone
When I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me by my walk
You're gonna miss me by my talk, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gonePlease don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me reaching out for someone I can't see
Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'd be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears andGod, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?
Woe is me, if we're not careful turns into reality
Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears andGod, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the sameGod, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I heard you out there cryingBut are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel aliveWe keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen stillSo you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come homeLoving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier,
Remember that with every piece of you
Hm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we dieHm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen stillSo you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be aloneAnd if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come homeYou can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soulAnd if you hurt me
Well, that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you goWhen I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone,
"Wait for me to come home."Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with meWhy am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurtOh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with meOh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with meOh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with meAnna:

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
She is the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
'We were born sick,' you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
Amen. Amen. AmenTake me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my lifeTake me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my lifeIf I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
To drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry workTake me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my lifeTake me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my lifeNo masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Amen. Amen. AmenTake me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

Whose soul aches[Pre-Chorus]
I'm at home
On my own
Check my phone
Nothing, though
Act busy
Order in
Pay TV
It's agony[Chorus]
I may cry, ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breakingTough girl
I'm in pain
It's lonely at the top
Blackouts and airplanes
I still pour you a glass of champagne
I'm a tough girl
Whose soul aches[Pre-Chorus]
I'm at home
On my own
Check my phone
Nothing, though
Act busy
Order in

Big girls cry when their hearts are breakingWhen I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she' stay strong yeah yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone and they sayDo you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating-

I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought

You look like my next mistake

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekendSo it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your nameCherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydreamSo it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar

And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apartNobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the startI was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heartTell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we areNobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the startOh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
X4There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will doThere's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the darkThe scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beatingThrow your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

La Industria Inc.Hey, once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, when face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fadeOne day my father—he told me,
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say,"When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid."He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember."
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told meWhen thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shinning stars
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores.
Don't forsake this life of yours.
I'll guide you home no matter where you are."One day my father—he told me,
"Son, don't let it slip away."
When I was just a kid I heard him say,"When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid."He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember."
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told meThese are the nights that never die
My father told meLike a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosionAnd all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this timeThis is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
(Starting right now) I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in meLosing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (I'm in too deep)
And it's been two years
I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
And I still believe
Yeah I still believeAnd all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this timeThis is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
(Starting right now) I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in meA lot of fight left in meLike a small boat

Guess she gave you things I didn't give to youOld friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the lightI hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't overNever mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts insteadYou know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory daysI hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't overNever mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeahNothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you

The moon, and the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own storyYou told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonightI'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)

And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonightLay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, youYo te miro, se me corta la respiración
Can I realign?
They say it's easy to leave you behind
I don't want tryCut cover, take that test
Hold courage to your chest
Don't wanna wait for you
Don't wanna have to lose
All that I've compromised
to feel another high
I've got to keep it down tonightAnd oh, oh, oh
I was a king under your control
And oh, oh, oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go
So let me goDon't you remember how I used to like
Being on the line?
I dreamed you dreamed of me calling out my name
Is it worth the price?Cut cover, take that test
Hold courage to your chest
Don't wanna wait for you
Don't wanna have to lose
All that I've compromised
to feel another high
I've got to keep it down tonightAnd oh, oh, oh
I was a king under your control
And oh, oh, oh
I wanna feel like you've let me goI had to break myself to carry on
No love and no admission
Take this from me tonight
Oh, let's fight
Oh, let's fight
Oh, let's fight
OhAnd oh, oh, oh
I was a king under your control
And oh, oh, oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go
So let me goLet go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everythingThe snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
not a footprint to be seen.
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen.
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried.
Don't let them in, don't let them see.
Be the good girl you always have to be.
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know.
Well, now they know!Let it go, let it go!
Can't hold it back any more.
Let it go, let it go!
Turn away and slam the door.
I don't care what they're going to say.
Let the storm rage on.
The cold never bothered me anyway.It's funny how some distance,
makes everything seem small.
And the fears that once controlled me, can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do,
to test the limits and break through.
No right, no wrong, no rules for me.
I'm free!Let it go, let it go.
I am one with the wind and sky.
Let it go, let it go.
You'll never see me cry.
Here I'll stand, and here I'll stay.
Let the storm rage on.My power flurries through the air into the ground.
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back; the past is in the past!Let it go, let it go.
And I'll rise like the break of dawn.
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand, in the light of day.Let the storm rage on!
The cold never bothered me anyway...You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in a way it hurtsFor months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you hereYou say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only oneYou've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mineYou say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only oneI have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us upYou say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everythingI've got gadgets and gizmos a plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!
But who cares? No big deal,
I want moreI wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancingWalking around on those
What do you call 'em? Oh, feetFlipping your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a
What's that word again?
StreetUp where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be, part of that worldWhat would I give if I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day
Warm on the sand?Betcha' on land, they'd understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women, sick of swimming
Ready to standAnd ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word?
Burn?When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that worldOh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday.Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she doesn't see what I see
But every time she ask me do I look okay?
I sayWhen I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you areAnd when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you areHer lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everydayOh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll sayWhen I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you areAnd when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you areThe way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing
Just the way you areWhen I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change

But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your earI've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughedI guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtueBut I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Open up your mind and see like me

This is, this is, this is our fate
I'm yoursOh, I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, whoa, baby you believe I'm yours
You best believe, best believe I'm yours[Gotye]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still rememberYou can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was overBut you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to knowNow you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know[Kimbra]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know[Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
And you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to knowSomebody
(I used to know)
Somebody
(Now you're just somebody that I used to know)(I used to know)

Kau bercerita semalam kita bertemu dalam mimpi
Entah mengapa aku merasakan hadirmu di sini
Tawa candamu menghibur saatku sendiriAku di sini dan kau di sana
Hanya berjumpa via suara
Namun ku slalu menunggu saat kita akan berjumpaMeski kau kini jauh di sana
Kita memandang langit yang sama
Jauh di mata namun dekat di hatiDering telefonku membuatku tersenyum di pagi hari
Tawa candamu menghibur saatku sendiriAku di sini dan kau di sana
Hanya berjumpa via suara
Namun ku slalu menunggu saat kita akan berjumpaMeski kau kini jauh di sana
Kita memandang langit yang sama
Jauh di mata namun dekat di hatiAku di sini dan kau di sana
Hanya berjumpa via suara
Namun ku slalu menunggu saat kita akan berjumpaMeski kau kini jauh di sana
Kita memandang langit yang sama
Jauh di mata namun kau dekat di hatiJarak dan waktu takkan berarti
Karena kau akan selalu di hati
Bagai detak jantung yang kubawa kemanapun kupergiMeski kau kini jauh di sana
Kita memandang langit yang sama
Jauh di mata namun dekat di hati
dekat di hati
dekat di hatiDo you hear me,
I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my, baby I'm trying
Boy I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard[Chorus]
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home againOh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohThey don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you I promise you, I will[Chorus]Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home somedayAnd so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
Though the breezes through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now[Chorus]I'm lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home somedayOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohLet it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, Let it go
Turn my back and slam the doorThe snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I triedDon't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always had to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well now they knowLet it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anywayIt's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
Up here in the cold thin air I finally can breathe
I know I left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieveLet it go, Let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, Let it go,
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anywayStanding - frozen in the life I've chosen
You won't find me, the past is so behind me
Buried in the snowLet it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go,
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway...
(let the music go on)

As long as my credit could vouch
A dog couldn't catch me, straight upTell me who could stop when
Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving the flavor with the homies
Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakersShorty get down, good Lord

Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite thingsCream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things.Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite thingsWhen the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so badRaindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens

And then I don't feel so bad.Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullabySomewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true ooh ohSomeday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find meOh, somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
And the dream that you dare to,
Oh why, oh why can't I?Well I see trees of green and red roses too,
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful worldWell I see skies of blue
And I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day
I like the dark
And I think to myself
What a wonderful worldThe colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, "How do you do?"
They're really saying, I...I love youI hear babies cry and I watch them grow,
They'll learn much more than we'll know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world worldSomeday I'll wish upon a star,
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top
That's where you'll find meOh, somewhere over the rainbow way up high
And the dream that you dare to, why, oh why can't I? I?Are you, are you

They strung up a man
They say who murdered three.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight
In the hanging tree.Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where the dead man called out
For his love to flee.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight
In the hanging tree.Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where I told you to run,
So we'd both be free.

In the hanging tree.Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of hope,
Side by side with me.

And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star
And thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here,
I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them, too?So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us homeI can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing 'Chasing Cars'
And I thought of us
Back to the time,
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars?
Over Amsterdam
You're the song my heart is
Beating toSo open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us homeAnd, oh, I know
And oh, I know, oh
I can see the stars
From AmericaMy anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hunBoy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dunMy anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like

Come on!Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en roseWhen you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en roseWhen you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom*And when you speak, angels, sing from above
Everyday words seem
To turn into love songsGive your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en roseRepeat*Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance
Now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to surviveSo many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge
Of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the
Eye of the tigerFace to face, out in the heat
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds
Still we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive[Chorus]Risin' up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance
Now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive[Chorus]The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tigerIt's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, nothing on me
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave yeah
In the back of the cab
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast

Harder, harder, harderI let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved meMy hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feetBut there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always winBut I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your nameWhen laying with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing gets betterCause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always winBut I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your nameI set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that
That was the last time, the last timeSometimes I wake up by the door
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for youI set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your nameI set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh
Oh, ohLet it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn[Niall]I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time[Liam]I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight
Like us
Did they ever fight
Like us
[Harry]You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above can
Separate the two of us
No nothing can come between
You and I
Oh, you and I[Zayn]I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground[Louis and Zayn]I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
Cause they see things in a different light
Like us
They never tried
Like us[Harry]You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above can
Separate the two of us[Instrumental][Chorus]
(Zayn)
'Cause You and I
(All)
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above can
Separate the two of us
No nothing can come between
You and I
Oh, you and I
Ooooh You and I
We could make it if we try
Oh, you and I
You and IWe'll do it all
Everything
On our ownWe don't need
Anything
Or anyoneIf I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?I don't quite know
How to say
How I feelThose three words
Are said too much
They're not enoughIf I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
That's bursting into lifeLet's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our headsI need your grace
To remind me
To find my ownIf I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
That's bursting into lifeAll that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes
They're all I can seeI don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things
Will never change for us at allIf I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?You make it look like it's magic

I can tell youI used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to ownI used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sandI hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign fieldFor some reason I can't explain
Once you're gone there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the worldIt was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd becomeRevolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign fieldFor some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Woahahahah oh, woahahah oh
Woahahahah oh, woahahah oh,
WoahahahahI hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign fieldFor some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the worldooooooh ooh oooooh oh ooooooh oh oooooh ooh.[Sia:]
You shout it out,
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up[Chorus:]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium[Sia:]
Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much[Chorus:]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium[Sia:]
Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard as bulletproof glass[Chorus:]
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titaniumHey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, heyYour lipstick stains
On the front part of my
Left side brain
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you
Blow my mindYour sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every
Single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kindHey soul sister
Ain't that Mr. mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you knowHey soul sister
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do
TonightHey, hey, heyJust in time
I'm so glad you have
A one track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection
We can't denyI'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat
Right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you
Like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mindHey soul sister
Ain't that Mr. mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know

Watching you is the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming ofYou see, I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be with meHey soul sister

A single thing you do
TonightHey soul sister
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do
TonightHey, hey, hey
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey
TonightIt's just an old beat up truck,
Some say that I should trade up
Now that I got some jangle in my pocket
But what they don't understand
Is it's the miles that make a man
I wouldn't trade that thing in for a rocket
What they don't know is my dad and me
We drove her out to Tennessee
And she's still here and now he's gone
So I hold onIt's just an old beat up box,
Its rusty strings across the top
It probably don't look like much to you
But these dents and scratches in the wood,
Yeah, that's what makes it sound so good
To me it's better than brand new
You see this here flat top guitar,
Has had my back in a million bars
Singing every country song
So I hold on[Chorus]
To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold onLike the stripes to the flag,
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold onYeah, baby, looking at you right now,
There ain't never been no doubt
Without you I'd be nothing
So if you ever worry about
Me walking out
Yeah, let me tell you something
I hold on
I hold on
Can you hear me, baby?
I hold on
Yea,
I hold onTo the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strongTo the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on
I hold on
I hold on and on and on and on and on
I hold on and on and on and on and onDo you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each otherBut the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let goBlow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean onBlow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean onWhat will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll overWhen the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let goBlow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean onBlow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean onAll we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean onBlow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean onBlow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow,
Only know you love her when you let her go.Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go...
And you let her go.Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow, and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart

But never to touch and never to keep
Cause you loved her too much, and you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

(You got that super bass)At first I was afraid I was petrified
Thinking I couldn't live without you by my side
And I've been spending nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And now you're back
From outer space
And I find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
Oh made you leave your key
If I've known for a second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And all my love to give and I'll survive
I, I, I will surviveIt took all my strength not to fall apart
Trying' without my mind to mend my broken heart
I spent so many nights
Feeling sorry for myself, how I cried
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that lonely little person who's still in love with you
Now you come dropping in
Expecting me to be free
Now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me
Go on now, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Think I'd might crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got my life to live
And all my love to give and I'll survive
I, I, I will surviveGo and go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble

Now it looks as though they're here to stay
oh, I believe in yesterdaySuddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.Why she had to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday.Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday.Why she had to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday.Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday...Yea, yea I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and, since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yea, they love me everywhere I used to cop in Harlem,
All of my Dominicano's right there up on Broadway,
Pull me back to that McDonald's, took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons wippin' pastry's
Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say whattup to Ty-Ty, still sippin' Mai Tai's
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high five
Nigga I be Spike'd out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely fromIn New York,
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New YorkCatch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act
Eight million stories, out there in it naked
City is a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I got a plug, Special Ed "I Got It Made"
If Jesus payin' Lebron, I'm payin' Dwayne Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three card monte
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire St. that'sIn New York,
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New YorkLights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
Lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
End of the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on the whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an AmbienIn New York,
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New YorkOne hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New YorkI threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me I'll never tell
I looked at you as it fell
And now you're in my wayI trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my wayYour stare was holding
Ripped jeans
Skin was showing
Hot night
Wind was blowing

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain,

She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones,
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone.Pre-chorus - Zayn
And I'll be gone gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in betweenChorus - Harry
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...

I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)Verse 2 - Niall

Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing offDriving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She said it was something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wantsWe're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and youChasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to stopMoving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wantsWe're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?

Disappearing when you wake up

Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lostWe're only getting older baby

Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
